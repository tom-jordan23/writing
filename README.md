## What Makes This Different from Generic AI Writing

**Without your style guide:**
- Generic corporate voice
- No specific examples
- Misses open source advocacy
- Wrong depth for audience
- Uses idioms (bad for translation)
- Impersonal, sterile tone

**With your style guide:**
- YOUR voice (open source leader, emergency responder, community mentor)
- Specific versions, costs, timelines, commands
- Open source solutions highlighted
- Right depth: strategic for execs, deep for engineers
- Translation-friendly (critical for humanitarian work)
- Warm: "Everyone is welcome. This work is hard. You don't need to be perfect."

**Big difference.**

## Checklist: Before You Send

Quick scan of AI output:

- [ ] Right depth for audience? (Strategic for execs, technical for engineers)
- [ ] Specific examples? (Not just "use MFA" but "FreeOTP, Duo, or YubiKey")
- [ ] Evidence cited? (Peer institutions, deployments, frameworks)
- [ ] Open source mentioned? (When applicable)
- [ ] Translation-friendly? (No idioms like "low-hanging fruit")
- [ ] Warm tone? (Not sterile corporate speak)

If missing, tell AI: "Add more [specific examples / warmth / technical depth]"

## When Something Feels Off

**Output doesn't sound like you?**
→ Make sure you uploaded the style guide file (not just wrote the prompt)

**Too formal/corporate?**
→ Remind: "Use the warm, peer-to-peer tone from the guide"

**Too generic?**
→ Remind: "Include specific tools, versions, and costs like in the guide"

**Uses idioms?**
→ Remind: "This will be translated. Avoid idioms. Use clear, literal language."

**Wrong depth?**
→ Check you used right audience file (Executive vs Technical makes huge difference)

---

## Bottom Line

- Your background (open source, standards, emergency response, mentorship)
- Your style (framework-based, specific, evidence-based, warm)
- Your values (anti-oppressive, translation-friendly, technology serves people)
- Your voice for 6 different audiences

**When you're busy:**
1. Pick the right file from the table at top
2. Give AI your bullet points
3. Upload the file
4. Get a draft in 30 seconds

That's it.

The guides do the heavy lifting. You just provide the content and direction.
