**Pattern**: Strategic variation for emphasis and rhythm

**Short sentences** (5-12 words) used for:
- Opening impact: "The higher education security landscape has transformed significantly in recent years."
- Emphasis: "Once inside a network, threat actors tend to move laterally."
- Transition points: "Zero-trust begins by defining a 'protect surface.'"
- Problem statements: "Cybersecurity incidents are dynamic situations."

**Medium sentences** (15-25 words) used for:
- Standard exposition
- Connecting ideas
- Building arguments

**Long sentences** (30+ words) used for:
- Complex explanations requiring multiple clauses
- Lists embedded in prose
- Contextualizing technical details

**Example of variation**:
> "An incident response plan is a critical part of any cybersecurity portfolio, but plans need to be tested and practiced to be executed successfully." [24 words - medium]
>
> "Cybersecurity incidents are dynamic situations, and discovering that your plan is incomplete or inflexible as an incident unfolds is problematic." [21 words - medium]

### Paragraph Construction
**Average paragraph length**: 3-5 sentences
**Pattern**: Shorter paragraphs for web readability

**Opening paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences establishing context or problem
**Body paragraphs**: 3-5 sentences developing a single idea
**Transition paragraphs**: 1-2 sentences bridging sections

**Paragraph rhythm**: Follows a "statement-elaboration-implication" pattern
1. Topic sentence stating the point
2. Supporting detail or explanation
3. Practical implication or connection to next idea

### Punctuation Signature

**Em-dashes (—)**: High frequency, used for:
- Parenthetical clarification: "two foundational publications—1975's 'Protection of information in computer systems' and ISO/IEC Technical Standard 19249:2017"
- Explanatory asides: "which assume internal users and devices are inherently trustworthy—cannot adequately protect organizations anymore"
- Defining or renaming: "the 'protect surface'—an organization's most critical data, assets, applications, and services"

**Colons**: Used to introduce:
- Lists (both bulleted and inline)
- Explanations: "Base access decisions on permission, not exclusion"
- Elaborations: "Keep security controls simple: limit complexity and errors"

**Quotation marks**: Strategic use for:
- Emphasis on key terms: "widely reported," "almost never," "lift and shift," "hotwash"
- Industry jargon being defined: "protect surface," "microperimeters"
- Ironic or colloquial usage: "find the right partners"

**Semicolons**: Occasional use for connecting closely related independent clauses

**Commas**: Standard usage, with frequent serial commas in lists

## II. LINGUISTIC ARCHITECTURE

### Sentence Types and Complexity

**Declarative sentences dominate** (95%+): Straightforward statements of fact, analysis, or recommendation

**Interrogative sentences**: Rare, used strategically in headers
- "What Are Tabletop Exercises?"
- "What Is Zero-Trust Architecture?"
- Never rhetorical; always answered directly

**Imperative sentences**: Used for direct recommendations
- "Remember to reserve some time for introspection and feedback."
- "Be sure to allow time and space to unpack these failures."

**Complex sentence patterns**: Frequent use of subordinate clauses
- Conditional: "If this is your organization's first time running a cybersecurity response exercise, the objective may simply be to pull together the teams."
- Temporal: "When a vendor stops issuing security updates or fails to keep pace with modern releases, institutions should start asking hard questions."
- Causal: "Because application ownership is often distributed across campuses, creating complexity..."

### Voice Patterns

**Active voice strongly preferred** (80%+)
- "Universities face particular difficulties"
- "Organizations should find the right partners"
- "Tabletop exercises help improve an organization's incident response"

**Strategic passive voice** (20%) used when:
- Process focus is more important than actor: "Access decisions should be based on permission"
- Deflecting criticism diplomatically: "Plans need to be tested and practiced"
- Describing universal states: "Once inside a network, threat actors tend to move laterally"

### Verb Patterns

**Present tense predominates** for:
- General truths: "Zero-trust architecture acknowledges that infiltration points don't determine ultimate targets"
- Current states: "Higher education institutions face particular difficulties"

**Modal verbs** signal different recommendation strengths:
- **Should**: Standard recommendation ("Organizations should find the right partners")
- **Must/need to**: Stronger imperative ("must be kept current," "need to be tested")
- **Can**: Possibility or capability ("can reduce costs," "can be a great starting point")
- **May**: Weaker possibility ("may simply be to pull together teams")
- **Might**: Speculation ("might become a growing concern")

**Action verbs favored over state-of-being verbs**:
- "Organizations face" not "have"
- "Systems expose" not "are vulnerable"
- "Exercises teach" not "are useful for teaching"

### Modifier Usage

**Adjectives**: Precise and functional rather than decorative
- Technical precision: "granular Layer 7 policies," "fine-grained policies"
- Quantifiers: "significant changes," "particular difficulties," "critical assets"
- Avoids hyperbole: "important" rather than "crucial" or "vital"

**Adverbs**: Used sparingly for precision
- Frequency: "often," "typically," "increasingly," "already"
- Manner: "substantially," "significantly," "directly"
- Degree: "substantially mitigate," "clearly defined," "fully developed"

**Compound modifiers**: Frequent and hyphenated correctly
- "custom-built hardware"
- "location-based trust assumptions"
- "high-profile ransomware attacks"
- "vendor-imposed deadlines"

- **Medium balanced for flow**: Most common; maintains readability

**Stress patterns**:
- Content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) carry emphasis
- Function words (articles, prepositions) support structure
- Natural speech rhythm; reads aloud smoothly

**Rhythmic repetition** (anaphora):
- List items begin with parallel structures
- Repeated sentence openings for emphasis
- Example: Multiple paragraphs starting with "When..."

### Parallel Structures

**In lists** (frequent):
- Noun phrases: "users, applications, and access methods"
- Verb phrases: "planning, training and evaluation"
- Gerunds: "Rehosting," "Replatforming," "Rearchitecting," "Rebuilding," "Replacing"

**In explanations**:
- Balanced clauses: "the differentiating features of today become tomorrow's standard expectations"
- Repeated syntax: "If [condition], [recommendation]"

**Rule of threes** (tricolon):
- "technical, administrative, or physical" [controls]
- "users, applications, and access methods"
- "planning, training and evaluation"

### Sound Devices (Subtle)

**Alliteration** (occasional, never forced):
- "protect surface" and "protect platforms"

- Continuation of main numbered list

**Closing paragraph patterns**:
1. **Synthesis**: Brings together main themes
2. **Forward-looking**: Points to future considerations
3. **Action orientation**: What to do next
4. **Humanistic note**: Acknowledges people and change

**Example**:
> "Legacy technology platforms often reach peak popularity as new systems are introduced. Organizations do well by honoring the successes of the old system, acknowledging those who supported it and reflecting on good lessons that should be carried forward."

**Never includes**:
- "In conclusion" or similar phrases
- Simple restatement of introduction
- New information not discussed before
- Call to action (not sales-oriented)

### Visual Structure for Scannability

**Techniques for web reading**:
- Frequent headers break up text
- Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)
- Bulleted lists for related items
- Numbered lists for sequential items
- Bold for key terms (in original publication format)
- White space between sections

**Information hierarchy**:
- Most important concepts in headers
- Supporting details in body

## VIII. COHESION AND COHERENCE DEVICES

### Transition Strategies

**Between sections** (explicit transitions):
- "Beyond [previous concept], it's important to [new concept]"
- "In addition to [X], [Y]"
- "Once [condition established], [next step]"
- "After [action], [subsequent action]"

**Between paragraphs** (implicit and explicit):
- **Explicit connectors**: "However," "While," "In addition," "Beyond"
- **Pronoun reference**: "This," "These," "It" referring to previous concepts
- **Repeated keywords**: Terms from end of one paragraph appear at start of next
- **Logical progression**: Next paragraph answers question raised by previous

**Within paragraphs**:
- Subordinate clauses connect ideas within sentences
- Serial commas link related items
- Parallel structures create cohesion

### Reference and Deixis

**Pronoun usage**:
- "This" + noun phrase: "This approach," "These threats," "This can be"
- "It" for singular concepts: "It's important to," "It can be difficult"
- Demonstratives with clear antecedents: Always clear what "this" or "these" refers to

**Temporal references**:
- Recent past: "COVID-19," "the pandemic," "recent years"
- Historical: "A 2014 vulnerability," "Created by John Kindervag"
- Present: "now face," "have become"
- Future: "will lead to," "going forward"

**Spatial/conceptual deixis**:
- "Here are some signs..."
- "the following approaches"
- "these factors"

### Topic Maintenance

**Keyword consistency**:
- Once a term is introduced, it's used consistently
- No needless synonym variation that might confuse
- Example: "zero-trust architecture" used repeatedly, not varied to "no-trust model" or similar

**Semantic fields maintained**:
- Security articles stay in security vocabulary
- Modernization articles stay in infrastructure vocabulary
- Consistent metaphors: "landscape," "ecosystem," "platform"

**Thematic threads**:
- Problem introduced early is resolved by end
- Questions raised are answered
- Examples support a central thesis

### Lexical Cohesion

**Repetition** (strategic, not excessive):
- Key concepts repeated for emphasis
- Important phrases echo throughout
- "It's important/critical/time to" structure repeats

**Collocation** (words that naturally appear together):
- "threat actors" (not "threats" and "actors" separated)
- "attack surface"
- "incident response"
- "legacy technology"
- Technical phrases used as units

**Hyponymy** (general-to-specific relationships):
- General: "security controls"
- Specific: "technical, administrative, or physical"
- Maintains clear hierarchies

---

## IX. NARRATIVE AND STORYTELLING ELEMENTS

### Use of Examples and Anecdotes

**Concrete examples preferred** over abstract discussion:
- **Historical incidents**: Heartbleed Bug as opening example
- **Quantified evidence**: "34,000 U.S. systems," "a decade later"
- **Specific technologies**: "TPM 2.0 and Windows 10"
- **Named frameworks**: Rather than "a government framework," uses "NIST Risk Management Framework"

**Anecdotal elements** (minimal but effective):
- References lived experience: "Your IT department may already participate"
- Acknowledges common scenarios: "staff leave for more exciting opportunities"
- Points to shared experiences: COVID-19 impact on higher ed

**Example structure**:
1. General principle stated
2. Specific example provided
3. Implication drawn

*Example*:
> "Application ownership is often distributed across campuses, creating complexity. Universities typically support core student, HR, and teaching systems alongside specialized tools for power plant management, police operations, housing, patient records, and event management."

### Scene-Setting (Minimal)

**Context-setting** rather than narrative scenes:
- Describes situations: "As an incident unfolds"
- Sets up scenarios: "If this is your organization's first time running a cybersecurity response exercise"
- Paints landscapes: "The higher education security landscape has transformed"

**No dramatic storytelling**:
- No dialogue
- No character development
- No plot arcs
- Focus on exposition and explanation

### Point of View

**Primary POV**: **Third-person objective with first-person plural inclusion**

**Third-person dominant**:
- "Organizations face," "Institutions should," "Universities encounter"
- Professional distance maintained
- Describes rather than experiences

**First-person plural** (strategic):
- "our IT ecosystems" - Creates community
- Includes author in higher ed IT world
- Never first-person singular ("I")

**Second-person** (selective):
- "your organization," "you've determined"
- Used when giving direct advice
- Positions reader as decision-maker

### Temporal Perspective

**Present-focused** with historical context:
- Most content in present tense
- Historical examples set up current situations
- Future implications mentioned but not speculative

**Time markers**:
- "Recent years," "in recent years"
- "A decade later"
- "Going forward"
- "Traditional... cannot adequately protect anymore"

## XVI. EXPERT SYNTHESIS AND CROSS-CUTTING INSIGHTS

### Integration Across Analytical Dimensions

**Primary style DNA** (from pattern integration):
1. **Authority through specificity**: Credibility comes from naming exact frameworks, versions, dates
2. **Accessibility through structure**: Complexity made approachable via clear organization
3. **Pragmatism through balance**: Acknowledges challenges while offering solutions
4. **Education through application**: Explains principles via practical implementation

**Reinforcing pattern combinations**:
- **Credibility + Accessibility**: Cites NIST standards but explains them clearly
- **Urgency + Pragmatism**: Acknowledges serious threats but offers systematic approaches
- **Technical depth + Readability**: Uses precise terminology but defines in context
- **Authority + Humility**: Expert voice but acknowledges complexity

### What Makes This Voice Unique

**Distinctive intersection**:
- **Practitioner + Educator**: Not just doing or teaching, but both simultaneously
- **Technical + Humanistic**: Discusses technology but centers people and change
- **Authoritative + Accessible**: Expert but not exclusive or condescending
- **Strategic + Practical**: Big-picture thinking with implementation details

**The "Tom Jordan" voice is**:
- The senior colleague who's already solved this problem
- The conference speaker who makes complex topics clear
- The advisor who acknowledges your constraints
- The practitioner who's learned from actual implementation
- The educator who wants you to succeed

**What it's not**:
- The academic researcher explaining theory
- The vendor selling a solution
- The journalist reporting news
- The guru proclaiming revolution
- The consultant promising easy answers

## Conclusion: The Essence of Tom Jordan's Style

Tom Jordan's writing succeeds because it **respects the intelligence of its audience while making complex topics accessible**. It builds authority through **specificity and framework knowledge** rather than self-promotion. It **acknowledges real-world complexity** while providing **systematic, actionable guidance**. Most importantly, it recognizes that **technology problems are also people problems**, and addresses both with equal seriousness.

To write like Tom Jordan:
1. **Position yourself** as an experienced peer, not a distant expert or salesperson
2. **Structure rigorously** with clear headers, lists, and scannable paragraphs
3. **Build credibility** through specific frameworks, examples, and balanced analysis
4. **Write accessibly** by defining terms, varying rhythm, and keeping paragraphs short
5. **Stay grounded** by acknowledging complexity, limitations, and change management
6. **Focus on application** rather than pure theory or abstract principles
7. **End practically** with implementation guidance and forward-looking perspective

This style works because it **serves the reader** first—providing the knowledge, context, and practical guidance they need to make better decisions and implement better solutions in their complex institutional environments.
