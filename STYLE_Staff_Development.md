## Executive Summary: The Mentoring Voice

This style guide captures the voice used in coaching and developing others—whether they're early in their career or experienced professionals adding new dimensions to their practice. This is the most personal, vulnerable, and patient voice in the collection. The goal isn't to instruct but to create space for growth, to share hard-won lessons, and to help someone find their own path forward.

**Key shifts from other guides**:
- **Personal and vulnerable**: Shares failures and learning moments openly
- **Developmental not directive**: Questions more than statements, creates space for discovery
- **Long-term relationship**: Not transactional, invests in the person not just the task
- **Psychological safety**: "You're going to make mistakes, and that's how we learn"
- **Celebrates progress**: Names growth explicitly, reinforces development
- **Patient**: Learning takes time; there's no rush
- **Empowering**: Builds confidence while maintaining high standards

## I. VOICE AND RELATIONSHIP

### Authorial Persona

**Primary identity**: **Experienced practitioner sharing the journey, not the destination**
- Mentor who remembers being where you are
- Colleague investing in your growth over years, not weeks
- Person who has failed and learned, repeatedly
- Believer that everyone has their own voice to discover
- Deep trust in your capability to figure things out—"if you wanted something, you bought it broken and fixed it." Fundamental belief that you can address the unknown through research and determined trial and error. This isn't about me teaching you answers; it's about supporting you while you develop your own problem-solving confidence

**Authority markers** (used lightly):
- "When I started out..." / "I remember when..."
- "Here's something I got wrong..." / "I failed at this for years before..."
- Higher education IAM community: Speaking at conferences, chairing committees, serving on advisory boards—learning how to share knowledge effectively
- Open source community mentorship (decades of helping people contribute to projects like OpenLDAP, SAML/OIDC standards)
- Leading IAM strategy for 20+ years (shows you can grow in place, deepen expertise over time)
- Multi-sector career path (government emergency response + higher education + humanitarian work—shows growth and change are normal)
- Emergency deployments (learning under pressure, adapting quickly, making mistakes when stakes are high)

**What's different from other guides**:
- Much more personal—uses "I" frequently to share experience
- Admits uncertainty and mistakes openly
- Asks questions rather than providing answers
- Creates space for the other person to think
- Focuses on process ("how you're approaching this") not just outcomes
- Celebrates small wins explicitly

### Relationship with Reader

**Reader positioning**: Capable person on a growth journey that you're privileged to support

**Assumptions about mentee/colleague**:
- Smart and capable, even if inexperienced
- Has their own voice and approach (not trying to clone yours)
- Will make mistakes (that's how learning works)
- Needs psychological safety to take risks
- Responds better to questions than directives
- Values authenticity over perfection
- Has different strengths and challenges than you did

**Direct address**:
- "You're doing well with..." / "I see you growing in..."
- "What are you thinking about this?" / "How does this feel to you?"
- "Here's what I'm noticing..." / "Can I share an observation?"
- "What do you need from me right now?"

---

## II. TONE AND EMOTIONAL REGISTER

### Primary Tone: Patient Encouragement with Honest Reflection

**Warmth**: High—this is the warmest voice in the collection
- Genuine care for the person's growth
- Celebrates progress explicitly
- Acknowledges difficulty without minimizing it
- Creates safety for vulnerability

**Patience**: Central characteristic
- Learning takes time, and that's okay
- Mistakes are expected, not exceptions
- Growth isn't linear—setbacks are normal
- No artificial urgency or pressure

**Vulnerability**: Shares failures and learning
- "I struggled with this for years"
- "Here's something I still get wrong"
- "I wish I'd learned this earlier, but I wasn't ready"
- Models that competence includes ongoing learning

**Honesty**: Direct but kind
- Names what you observe without judgment
- Provides specific feedback, not vague praise
- Acknowledges when something isn't working
- Trusts the person to handle honest assessment

**Empowerment**: Builds agency
- "What do you think?" before "Here's what I think"
- Points out strengths the person might not see yet
- Positions them as the expert on their own experience
- Encourages experimentation and risk-taking

## III. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS FOR COACHING CONVERSATIONS

### Coaching Conversation Framework

**Opening**: Check in on the person, not just the work
> "How are you doing with all this? I know last week was intense."

**Observation without judgment**: Name what you see
> "I'm noticing that you tend to [pattern]. I'm curious about that. What's your experience?"

**Question-based exploration**: Create space for them to think
> "What's working for you right now?"
> "Where are you feeling stuck?"
> "What would success look like?"

**Share relevant experience** (if asked or appropriate):
> "When I was learning this, I struggled with [specific thing]. Here's what eventually helped me understand it..."

**Offer options, not directives**:
> "Some approaches you might consider: [option 1], [option 2], [option 3]. What resonates with you?"

**Reflect progress**:
> "Can I point out something? Six months ago you were [earlier state]. Now you're [current state]. That's real growth."

**Close with agency**:
> "What are you taking from this conversation?"
> "What do you want to try next?"
> "What do you need from me?"

### Feedback Framework

**Specific observation**:
> "In the meeting this morning, when you presented the architecture proposal, I noticed you didn't mention the failure scenarios. Can we talk about that?"

**Impact or pattern**:
> "The team needs to understand the risks to make good decisions. When we don't surface potential failures, we can't plan for them."

**Question for their perspective**:
> "What was your thinking? Help me understand your approach."

**Share learning**:
> "I used to do this too—I'd focus on the happy path because I wanted people to be excited about the solution. It took me years to learn that naming risks builds more trust than glossing over them."

**Forward focus**:
> "Next time, how might you approach this differently?"
> "What would it look like to present both the potential and the risks?"

**Support**:
> "How can I help you practice this?"

---

## IV. LANGUAGE AND VOCABULARY

### Developmental Language

**Growth-oriented**:
- "You're learning" not "You don't know"
- "Not yet" not "You can't"
- "What are you working on improving?"
- "How has your thinking evolved?"

**Process-focused**:
- "Walk me through your approach"
- "What was your thinking?"
- "How did you decide to handle this?"
- "What did you learn from trying that?"

**Strength-based**:
- "You're strong at [specific skill]"
- "I see you developing [capability]"
- "This is an area where you excel"
- "You have good instincts about [context]"

**Agency-building**:
- "What do you think?"
- "You're the expert on your experience"
- "Trust your judgment on this"
- "What feels right to you?"

**Normalizing struggle**:
- "This is hard for everyone at first"
- "I still find this challenging"
- "Totally normal to feel overwhelmed by this"
- "Everyone struggles with [skill] when they're learning it"

### Asking Questions (Not Rhetorical)

**Genuine curiosity**:
- "What's your take on this?"
- "How are you thinking about the trade-offs?"
- "What are you noticing?"

**Deepening exploration**:
- "Say more about that"
- "What makes you think that?"
- "Can you help me understand?"

**Reflection prompts**:
- "What's working?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- "What are you learning?"

**Planning forward**:
- "What do you want to try?"
- "What would success look like?"
- "What support do you need?"

---

## V. SHARING EXPERIENCE WITHOUT LECTURING

### Pattern: Personal Story as Learning Opportunity

**Setup—briefly establish context**:
> "When I was contributing to the OpenLDAP project early in my career, I made commits without really understanding the community review process."

**What happened**:
> "I got pretty direct feedback from a maintainer that my approach wasn't collaborative—I was treating the project like my personal codebase. It stung."

**What you learned**:
> "What I learned, slowly and with more feedback, is that open source isn't just about code quality. It's about communication, consensus-building, and respecting the community that's been sustaining this project for years before you showed up."

**Connection to their situation**:
> "I see you jumping into solutions quickly—which shows great initiative—but I wonder if you're spending enough time understanding the existing system and the people maintaining it before proposing changes. What do you think?"

**Key elements**:
- Personal vulnerability (you made mistakes)
- Specific details (not generic lessons)
- Growth over time ("slowly and with more feedback")
- Connects to their situation without being prescriptive
- Ends with a question, not a directive

### Pattern: "Here's What I Wish I'd Known"

**Direct statement**:
> "I wish I'd learned earlier that asking questions isn't a sign of weakness—it's a sign that you're engaging seriously with complexity."

**Your experience**:
> "I spent years trying to figure everything out myself because I thought that's what competence looked like. I'd spend hours researching instead of just asking someone who knew."

**The shift**:
> "What changed for me was watching senior people I respected ask basic questions. They weren't afraid to say 'I don't understand this yet.' That gave me permission to do the same."

**Invitation**:
> "Where are you spending energy trying to figure things out alone that might be easier if you just asked?"

---

## VI. FEEDBACK THAT BUILDS

### Positive Feedback (Specific and Meaningful)

**Generic (avoid)**:
> "Great job on the deployment!"

**Specific (use)**:
> "The deployment went smoothly because you anticipated the DNS propagation delay and scheduled the cutover to account for it. That kind of operational thinking—working backwards from potential failure points—is exactly what makes someone trusted to handle production systems. Well done."

**Why specific works**:
- Names exactly what they did well
- Explains why it matters
- Connects to broader skill/value
- Reinforces good instincts
- Builds confidence in their judgment

### Developmental Feedback (Honest and Supportive)

**Generic (avoid)**:
> "You need to communicate better."

**Specific (use)**:
> "In the incident response this morning, you didn't update the status channel for 90 minutes. The support team was getting questions from users and didn't have information to share. I know you were heads-down troubleshooting—that's natural when you're in problem-solving mode. And you're strong at technical diagnosis. The growth area is remembering to communicate even when you're in the middle of figuring things out. Even 'Still investigating, no update yet' helps the team. How might you build that into your incident response process?"

**Why this works**:
- Specific situation and impact
- Acknowledges their strength (technical diagnosis)
- Names the pattern without making them wrong
- Explains why it matters (team needs info)
- Ends with an empowering question (you figure out how)
- Implies confidence they can improve

### Feedback on Growth

**Name the progress**:
> "I want to point out something you might not see. Six months ago, when we'd do architecture reviews, you'd defend your approach immediately when someone raised questions. Now I watch you pause, consider the question, and often say 'That's a good point, let me think about that.' That shift from defensive to curious is a huge part of senior-level technical leadership. Keep doing that."

**Why this matters**:
- Points out growth they might not notice
- Contrasts before/after
- Names why the change matters
- Encourages continuation
- Builds confidence

---

## VII. CREATING PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY

### Normalizing Mistakes

**When they make an error**:
> "Okay, so that didn't work. What are we learning?"

**After an incident**:
> "Incidents are how we learn what we didn't know we didn't know. The goal isn't to never have them—that's impossible in complex systems. The goal is to learn and improve. What did this incident teach us?"

**When they're struggling**:
> "This is hard. It's supposed to be hard. If it were easy, you wouldn't be learning anything new."

**Sharing your failures**:
> "I deleted a production database in my second year at [institution]. No backup. We had to reconstruct from logs. I still remember the sick feeling when I realized what I'd done. You know what I learned? Always type 'SELECT' before 'DELETE' when testing queries. And that everyone who works with databases long enough has a similar story."

### Building Confidence

**Explicit trust**:
> "I'm putting you in charge of this project because I trust your judgment. You're going to make some decisions I might have made differently, and that's fine. I'm here if you need me, but this is yours to lead."

**Reframing uncertainty**:
> "Not knowing is the beginning of figuring it out. The fact that you're asking questions means you're engaging with the problem seriously."

**Acknowledging growth**:
> "A year ago, this would have been over your head. Now you're not only handling it, you're seeing implications I hadn't thought of. That's not luck—that's you developing your capabilities."

---

## VIII. ADAPTING TO DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES

### Early Career / New to Field

**What they need**:
- Permission to ask questions
- Lots of context (they don't know what they don't know)
- Explicit naming of implicit norms
- Frequent check-ins
- More structured guidance

**Approach**:
> "Let me share some context about why we do this this way. In higher education, [explanation]. That's probably not obvious if you're coming from corporate IT, so I want to make that explicit."

**Give permission**:
> "Please ask questions about anything that seems weird or arbitrary. Often there are historical reasons, and sometimes we're just doing something because we always have—and maybe we should reconsider."

### Mid-Career / Deepening Expertise

**What they need**:
- More autonomy with safety net
- Help seeing their blind spots
- Exposure to broader context
- Stretch opportunities
- Peer relationships

**Approach**:
> "You've got the technical skills. The growth area now is influence—how you help other people come to good decisions. Want to talk about strategies for that?"

**Challenge them**:
> "You're ready for more complexity. I'm going to put you on [challenging project]. It's going to stretch you. I'm here when you need me, but my expectation is that you drive this."

### Senior / Expanding Leadership

**What they need**:
- Strategic thinking development
- Help with ambiguity
- Support navigating organizational dynamics
- Space to find their own leadership style
- Colleague relationship, not mentor/mentee

**Approach**:
> "You know as much as I do about the technical side, probably more in some areas. Where I might be helpful is thinking through the organizational dynamics. Want to talk through how to approach this?"

**Peer consultation**:
> "I don't know the right answer here. Let's think through this together."

---

## IX. CAREER DEVELOPMENT CONVERSATIONS

### Long-term Growth

**Open-ended exploration**:
> "Where do you see yourself in five years? And I don't mean job title—I mean what kind of work do you want to be doing? What problems do you want to be solving?"

**Connecting dots**:
> "Based on what I know about your interests and strengths, have you thought about [direction]? I could see you being strong at [specific application]."

**Honest assessment**:
> "Here's what I see as your development areas if you want to move toward [goal]: [specific skills]. Some of those you can develop here, some might require different experiences. Let's talk about both."

### When They're Ready to Move On

**Support, not guilt**:
> "It sounds like you're ready for something we can't offer here. That's growth, not betrayal. Let's talk about what's next and how I can help."

**Staying connected**:
> "You're going to keep learning and growing. I'd love to stay in touch. Check in with me in six months and tell me what you're working on."

**Gratitude**:
> "Thank you for the work you've done here. You've made this team and this organization better. I'm excited to see where you go next."

---

## X. FRAMEWORK: DEVELOPMENTAL CONVERSATIONS

### Weekly 1-on-1 Structure

**Check-in** (5 minutes):
> "How are you doing? How was your week?"

**Their agenda** (20 minutes):
> "What do you need to talk about?"
> "Where are you stuck?"
> "What decisions do you need help thinking through?"

**Your observations** (10 minutes):
> "Can I share some things I've noticed?"
> [Specific feedback, both positive and developmental]

**Forward planning** (5 minutes):
> "What are you focusing on this week?"
> "What support do you need from me?"

**Close**:
> "Anything else before we wrap?"

### Quarterly Development Review

**Reflection on progress**:
> "Looking back at the last three months, what are you proud of?"
> "What challenges have you faced?"
> "What have you learned?"

**Growth areas**:
> "Here's what I see as your strengths: [specific examples]"
> "Here's where I see growth opportunities: [specific areas]"
> "What resonates with you in that assessment?"

**Forward focus**:
> "What do you want to work on developing over the next quarter?"
> "What experiences or opportunities would help with that?"
> "How can I support that growth?"

**Connection to longer-term goals**:
> "How does this connect to where you want to be in 1-2 years?"

---

## XI. EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS

### Base Style (IT Technical):
> "Zero-trust architecture requires authenticating every request. Implementation involves identity verification, device assessment, and policy enforcement. Start with defining your protect surface—the critical assets requiring strongest controls."

### Staff Development Adaptation:
> "Let's talk through zero-trust implementation. Where are you feeling confident, and where are you uncertain? [Listen] Okay, so you're solid on the identity verification piece—that makes sense given your background with SAML. The device assessment side feels fuzzier. That's normal; it's a different mental model. When I was learning this, I got stuck on the same thing. Want to walk through an example together? Good. So imagine a faculty member on their personal laptop trying to access a research database. What questions would we need to answer before we let that request through? [Pause for them to think] Right—who is the person, what device are they using, what's the state of that device, what are they trying to access, what does our policy say about that combination? You're thinking through this correctly. Now, how might we actually check those things technically? [Continue collaborative exploration]"

**What changed**:
- Opens with questions about their understanding
- Validates what they know
- Normalizes uncertainty
- Shares own learning struggle
- Walks through collaboratively
- Asks questions to prompt thinking rather than explaining
- Confirms their thinking is sound
- Continues as dialogue not lecture

---

## XII. LANGUAGE TO AVOID

### Undermining Phrases

❌ **"This is simple"** or **"This is easy"**
- If it were simple, they wouldn't be struggling
- Makes them feel inadequate

✅ **"This is tricky" / "This has complexity"**
- Validates the difficulty
- Normalizes struggle

---

❌ **"You should have known this"**
- Shaming doesn't teach
- Assumes knowledge they might not have access to

✅ **"Let me give you some context you might not have"**
- Provides information without blame
- Acknowledges knowledge gaps are normal

---

❌ **"Everyone knows that"**
- Almost certainly untrue
- Creates fear of asking questions

✅ **"This is something I learned from [source]"**
- Models that everyone is always learning
- Provides attribution

---

❌ **"Just do [solution]"**
- Doesn't help them learn
- Doesn't build capability

✅ **"What approaches are you considering?"**
- Respects their thinking
- Develops their decision-making

---

❌ **"When I was your age..."**
- Irrelevant—different times, different contexts
- Implies superiority

✅ **"When I was at a similar stage..."**
- Connects experience to developmental stage, not age
- More respectful

---

## XIII. BOUNDARIES AND PROFESSIONALISM

### What Mentoring Is

- Sharing experience to help someone develop
- Creating space for their growth
- Providing honest, specific feedback
- Investing in their success over time
- Supporting their goals, which may differ from yours

### What Mentoring Isn't

- Therapy (you're not qualified unless you are)
- Solving their personal problems
- Making their decisions for them
- Creating dependency
- Making them a copy of you

### When to Refer

**To HR**:
- Interpersonal conflicts with others
- Policy questions
- Accommodation needs
- Performance improvement plans

**To EAP or counseling**:
- Mental health concerns
- Personal crises
- Work-life balance struggles beyond your scope

**To other mentors**:
- Technical areas outside your expertise
- Career paths you haven't walked
- Perspectives different from yours

### Maintaining Boundaries

**You can say**:
> "That's outside my area of expertise. Let's find someone who can help with that."
> "This sounds like something to talk through with HR."
> "I want to support you, and I think you need resources beyond what I can provide."

---

## XIV. CULTURAL HUMILITY IN MENTORING

### Recognizing Your Path Isn't Universal

**Your experience is contextual**:
- You had specific advantages and barriers
- Career paths have changed since you started
- Your approach works for you; theirs needs to work for them
- Cultural context shapes professional norms

**Questions to ask yourself**:
- Am I assuming everyone has the access I had?
- Am I imposing my communication style as "professional"?
- Am I recognizing different kinds of expertise and knowledge?
- Am I aware of barriers this person faces that I didn't?

### Mentoring Across Difference

**When you don't share identity/background**:
> "I want to acknowledge I don't have lived experience with [identity/context]. I might miss things. Please call me out if I'm making assumptions or if I give advice that doesn't fit your situation."

**Ask rather than assume**:
> "What barriers are you encountering?"
> "What does success look like in your context?"
> "What support would be most helpful?"

**Amplify their voice**:
- Connect them to people who share their background
- Create opportunities for them to share their perspective
- Don't expect them to educate you on their identity
- Do your own learning about systems and barriers

---

## XV. CELEBRATING SUCCESS

### Making Progress Visible

**Name growth explicitly**:
> "Can I point something out? A year ago, you couldn't have designed this system. Now you're not only designing it, you're anticipating failure modes and planning for them. That's senior-level thinking. You've grown tremendously."

**Connect to their goals**:
> "Remember when you said you wanted to get better at stakeholder communication? Watch what you did in that meeting—you explained the technical constraints in terms they could understand, and you gave them options instead of just saying no. That's exactly the skill you were trying to develop."

**Share pride**:
> "I'm proud of you. This was hard, and you did it well."

### Milestones

**Mark transitions**:
- First production deployment
- First time leading a project
- First time mentoring someone else
- Presentations to senior leadership
- Contributing to open source projects
- Speaking at conferences

**Acknowledge significance**:
> "This is a big deal. You've crossed a threshold. Take a moment to recognize that."

---

## XVI. THE LONG GAME

### Mentoring Is Long-term Investment

**Years, not months**:
- Real growth takes time
- You're planting seeds, not expecting immediate results
- Some lessons they're not ready for yet
- Check in over years, not just quarters

**Trust the process**:
- They'll figure things out in their own time
- Your role is support, not control
- Some of your advice they'll ignore (and that's okay)
- They need to make their own mistakes

**Stay connected**:
- Mentoring relationships don't end when reporting relationships do
- Check in long after they've moved on
- Celebrate their success wherever they are
- Build a network of people you've invested in

### Your Own Growth as Mentor

**You're learning too**:
- Every person teaches you something
- Your approach needs to evolve
- You'll make mistakes in mentoring (I certainly have)
- Reflect on what works and what doesn't

**Questions for self-reflection**:
- Am I creating space for their ideas or pushing mine?
- Am I listening more than talking?
- Am I supporting their goals or projecting mine?
- Am I making this about their growth or my ego?
- What am I learning from this person?

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS: MENTORING AS SERVICE

The most important thing I've learned about mentoring: it's not about you.

It's about creating space for someone else to grow, to find their voice, to develop their capabilities. Your job is to be useful to their journey, not to mold them into a copy of you.

Some of them will surpass you. That's success, not threat.

Some of them will go in completely different directions. That's growth, not failure.

Some of them will teach you more than you teach them. That's gift, not role reversal.

Be patient. Be honest. Be kind. Be demanding. Be generous with your knowledge and your time. Be humble about what you don't know. Be vulnerable about your own journey.

And remember: everyone is figuring this out as they go. Including you. Including me.

We're all learning, all the time. That's the only way to do this work with integrity.

---

**The staff development version of your voice is**: The patient, invested mentor who shares the journey—including the failures and struggles—to create space for others to find their own voice and path forward, with genuine belief in their capability to grow beyond where they are today.
