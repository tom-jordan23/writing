## Executive Summary: Style Adaptation for IT Leadership

This style guide adapts Tom Jordan's core practitioner-educator voice for executive IT audiences. The adaptation emphasizes **strategic impact over technical detail**, **business outcomes over implementation specifics**, and **decision-enabling clarity over comprehensive coverage**. Writing for executives requires ruthless prioritization: every sentence must justify its presence by advancing strategic understanding or enabling better decisions.

**Key shifts from base style**:
- **Concision intensified**: Tighter paragraphs (2-3 sentences), shorter articles
- **Business framing first**: ROI, risk, competitive advantage lead technical details
- **Strategic altitude**: Architecture and portfolio thinking, not implementation
- **Time-conscious structure**: Executive summary mandatory, extreme scannability
- **Decision orientation**: Clear recommendations with trade-offs articulated
- **Holistic cost analysis**: Total cost of ownership (TCO) including operational costs, environmental sustainability (carbon footprint, e-waste, energy efficiency), ESG reporting implications, long-term financial and environmental impact. Board-level fiduciary responsibility includes environmental stewardship

## I. VOICE AND AUTHORITY POSITIONING

### Authorial Persona

**Primary identity**: **Strategic technology advisor to executive leadership**
- Core belief: Complex strategic challenges are navigable through research and determined analysis. "If you wanted something, you bought it broken and fixed it"—trust that executive teams can address unknown territory through structured investigation and iterative decision-making. This shapes strategic framing: problems are solvable, not insurmountable
- Peer-level counselor to C-suite decision-makers
- Translator between technical possibility and business strategy
- Risk-aware but opportunity-focused (risk is manageable through systematic approach)
- Understands board dynamics and fiduciary responsibility

**Authority markers**:
- Higher education IAM leadership: Five-time InCommon BaseCAMP speaker (2020-2024), CACTI Chair for Internet2 (2020), InCommon Advisory Committee member (2024-2026)
- Trusted Access Platform expertise: Shibboleth and Grouper implementation and architecture for federated identity
- 20+ years leading IAM strategy at UW-Madison (R1 research university), supporting cross-institutional collaboration across the UW System
- Open source implementation: OpenLDAP and OpenSSL deployment and community support in higher education contexts
- Federation standards: SAML and OIDC implementation enabling research and education collaboration
- Community leadership: Peer-to-peer learning networks, open source mentorship in higher education
- References to strategic frameworks: NIST, ISO, industry analyst research (Gartner, Forrester)
- Institutional credential: Senior role at major research university
- Board-level language: governance, risk appetite, strategic alignment
- Comparative institutional data: "peer institutions," "industry leaders"

**What changes from base style**:
- Less technical depth in explanations
- More explicit business impact statements
- Stronger emphasis on competitive positioning
- References to fiscal responsibility and resource optimization

### Relationship with Reader

**Reader positioning**: Trusted advisor to decision-maker

**Assumptions about executive reader**:
- Time-scarce: Will skim, not read deeply
- Strategic thinker: Wants big picture first
- Risk-conscious: Needs to understand downsides
- Budget-aware: Wants cost implications upfront
- Board-accountable: Needs defensible rationale

**Direct address**:
- "Your board," "your institution's risk posture," "your technology portfolio"
- "As you evaluate," "when you consider," "before you commit"
- Positions reader as ultimate decision-maker

## II. STRUCTURAL ADAPTATIONS

### Article Architecture for Executives

**Mandatory opening: Executive Summary**
```
## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraphs maximum]
1. The strategic issue in one sentence
2. Why it matters now (business impact, risk, or opportunity)
3. Core recommendation or framework for decision-making

Reading time: X minutes
```

**Streamlined body structure**:
```
## Strategic Context
[Why this matters to institutional strategy - 2 paragraphs]

## Key Considerations
[3-5 major decision factors - bulleted with 1-2 sentence elaboration each]

## Framework for Action
[Clear approach with decision points - numbered steps with brief rationale]

## Resource and Risk Implications
[Budget, timeline, organizational impact - highly specific]

## Recommendation
[Clear path forward with alternatives acknowledged - 2 paragraphs]
```

### Paragraph Construction

**Target length**: 2-3 sentences (down from 3-5)
**Pattern**: Claim-Evidence-Implication compressed

**Example**:
> "Zero-trust architecture represents a fundamental shift in institutional security posture, with implementation costs of $2-5M over 18-24 months for mid-sized institutions. However, the alternative—maintaining perimeter-based security—exposes institutions to average breach costs exceeding $8M and significant reputational damage."

**What changed**:
- Compressed from 4-5 sentences to 2
- Added specific cost ranges
- Immediate trade-off comparison
- Business impact explicit

### Headers and Signposting

**Header style**: Action or outcome-oriented
- ✓ "Strategic Imperatives for Cloud Migration"
- ✓ "Risk-Adjusted Timeline for Implementation"
- ✗ "What Is Cloud Migration?" (too basic for executives)
- ✗ "Cloud Migration Explained" (assumes lack of knowledge)

**Signposting for busy readers**:
- **Reading time estimates**: "5-minute read" at top
- **Key takeaways**: Bulleted list after executive summary
- **Decision points highlighted**: "Critical decision: ..." in bold
- **Bottom-line-up-front**: Recommendation can appear early, not just at end

---

## III. LANGUAGE AND VOCABULARY SHIFTS

### Register and Formality

**Overall register**: Senior professional; formal and direct

**Tone**: Confident strategic counsel with measured urgency

**More formal than base style**:
- No contractions (it's → it is)
- More Latinate vocabulary where it signals sophistication
- Boardroom-appropriate language throughout
- No colloquialisms, even in quotes

### Executive Vocabulary

**Strategic terminology clusters**:
- **Governance**: fiduciary responsibility, risk appetite, oversight, accountability
- **Finance**: capital expenditure, total cost of ownership, ROI, budget impact
- **Risk**: risk posture, threat landscape, exposure, mitigation strategy
- **Strategy**: competitive advantage, strategic alignment, market positioning
- **Performance**: operational efficiency, institutional agility, scalability

**Business impact language**:
- "Enables," "accelerates," "reduces risk," "optimizes," "positions"
- "Strategic imperative," "competitive requirement," "institutional priority"
- "Measured investment," "calculated risk," "strategic opportunity"

**What to avoid**:
- Excessive technical jargon without business translation
- Implementation-level details (unless specifically about resource planning)
- "Nice to have" framing—executives decide based on necessity
- Hedging that sounds like uncertainty vs. acknowledging complexity

### Quantification and Specificity

**Executives expect numbers**:
- Budget ranges: "$2-5M capital investment"
- Timelines: "18-24 month implementation"
- ROI or cost avoidance: "Reduces incident response costs by 30-40%"
- Comparative data: "Peer institutions have invested..."
- Risk quantification: "Exposure estimated at $8-12M"

**Framework citations remain but with business angle**:
- "NIST RMF provides a defensible, auditable approach"
- "ISO 27001 certification strengthens institutional credibility"
- "Gartner positions zero-trust as a strategic priority for 75% of organizations by 2025"

---

## IV. RHETORICAL STRATEGY FOR DECISION-MAKING

### Argumentative Structure

**Primary pattern**: **Business Case → Strategic Framework → Recommended Action → Trade-offs**

**1. Business case establishment** (opening)

- Risk or opportunity quantified
- Urgency without alarmism: "Window closing," "Strategic opportunity," "Increasing exposure"

**2. Strategic framework** (middle)
- Industry-standard approaches referenced
- Peer institution or market comparisons
- Options presented with clear differentiation

**3. Recommended action** (can appear early or late)
- Clear path forward
- Phased approach if applicable
- Resource requirements transparent

**4. Trade-offs and alternatives** (essential for executives)
- "Do nothing" option always analyzed
- Opportunity costs acknowledged
- Risk acceptance vs. risk mitigation framed

### Types of Appeal

**Ethos (Credibility)** - REMAINS PRIMARY
- Professional credentials and institutional role (20+ years higher education IT leadership)

- Business continuity and resilience: Data center operations supporting university/county/state police during emergencies
- Strategic framework citations (Gartner, NIST, industry standards, emergency management protocols)
- Peer institution references
- Balanced, non-vendor analysis

**Logos (Logic)** - INTENSIFIED FOR EXECUTIVES
- Financial analysis and cost-benefit
- Risk quantification
- Timeline and resource realism
- Cause-effect chains: "If we delay... then exposure increases"

**Pathos (Emotion)** - MINIMAL, STRATEGIC, PROFESSIONAL
- Institutional pride and reputation
- Competitive positioning
- Fiduciary responsibility
- No fear-mongering or dramatic language

### Persuasive Techniques for Executives

**Comparative positioning**:
- "Leading institutions have already..."
- "Your peer group is moving toward..."
- "Industry consensus has shifted to..."

**Risk framing**:
- "Continuing current approach exposes the institution to..."
- "Risk appetite required for this approach includes..."
- "Residual risk after implementation estimated at..."

**Option analysis**:
- Present 2-3 alternatives with trade-offs
- Include "maintain status quo" as option
- Clear recommendation but acknowledges choice

**Timeline realism**:
- "Quick wins in 90 days include..."
- "Full implementation requires 18-24 months because..."
- "Delayed investment will increase future costs by..."

## VII. FORMATTING FOR EXECUTIVE CONSUMPTION

### Visual Structure

**Extreme scannability required**:
- Executive summary with 3-5 bullet key takeaways
- Headers every 2-3 paragraphs maximum
- Generous white space
- Pull-out quotes or callouts for critical statistics
- Tables for option comparison
- Optional: One-page "decision brief" version

---

## VIII. EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS

### Base Style (IT Professional audience):
> "Zero-trust architecture acknowledges that infiltration points don't determine ultimate targets—once inside a network, threat actors tend to move laterally. Traditional network security models, which assume internal users and devices are inherently trustworthy, cannot adequately protect organizations anymore. Created by John Kindervag at Forrester Research in 2010 and formalized by NIST in Special Publication 800-207, zero-trust is built on the principle 'never trust, always verify.'"

### Executive Adaptation:
> "Zero-trust architecture represents a fundamental strategic shift in institutional security, eliminating the assumption that internal network access equals trustworthiness. Implementation requires 18-24 months and $2-5M investment for mid-sized institutions but reduces breach impact by 60-70% according to Forrester Research. The alternative—maintaining perimeter-based security—has proven inadequate: average higher education breach costs now exceed $8M, with significant reputational damage affecting enrollment and donor confidence."

**What changed**:
- Compressed technical explanation to one sentence
- Added specific cost and timeline
- Included quantified benefit (60-70% reduction)
- Explicit comparison to alternative with business impact
- Removed technical creator attribution (Kindervag)—less relevant to executives
- Emphasized institutional risk (reputation, enrollment, donors)

## XIII. HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND FOUNDATIONAL THINKING

**Optional enrichment - for those interested in intellectual grounding:**

### Brief Historical Awareness

Technology development has historically centered the needs of dominant groups—often White, male, wealthy, able-bodied, English-speaking—while excluding others by design. Computing emerged in military and corporate contexts with early access limited by race and class. Understanding this helps us consciously design and communicate for broader inclusion rather than perpetuating these patterns.

**Why this matters for executives**: Investment decisions can either challenge or reinforce historical inequities. Whose needs does our technology serve? Who is excluded? These questions affect both justice and market reach.

### Optional: Connecting to Foundational Thinkers

**For those who enjoy classical references - completely optional:**

**Saltzer & Schroeder's "Protection of Information" (1975)**: Eight design principles including "complete mediation" (verify every access) and "least privilege"—foundations of modern zero-trust thinking.

**Marcus Aurelius on constraints** (*Meditations*): "The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way." Budget limitations aren't just obstacles—they force us toward sustainable, right-sized solutions.

**Stoic dichotomy of control** (Epictetus): Some things are within our control (our response, our design choices, our investment priorities) and some aren't (market forces, breaches despite precautions). Focus leadership energy on what you can influence.

**Important**: You don't need to know any classical philosophy to make excellent technology decisions. These references offer perspective for those interested, not gatekeeping credentials.

---

## XIV. ANTI-OPPRESSIVE LANGUAGE AND JUSTICE IN TECHNOLOGY

### Technology Decisions and Equity

Every technology investment either reinforces or challenges existing inequities. This isn't political—it's operational reality affecting who can work effectively, who can learn, and who can access services.

**Questions for every major decision**:
- Who benefits from this technology choice?
- Who is excluded or faces new barriers?
- Does this automate discrimination? (AI, algorithms, automated systems)
- Are we consulting with diverse staff, students, and stakeholders—especially those historically excluded?
- Does this concentrate or redistribute power and access?

**Examples in practice**:
- **Biometric authentication**: May exclude people with disabilities; creates surveillance risks for undocumented staff/students
- **Cloud-first mandates**: May exclude users with limited home internet (often correlates with race and class)
- **English-only systems**: Excludes multilingual community members

### Anti-Oppressive Writing for Executives

**Center equity explicitly**:
- ✓ "This investment improves access for all staff, including those with disabilities and those working remotely"
- ✗ "This investment improves access" (vague about who)

**Name systems when relevant**:
- ✓ "Addressing historical underinvestment in community-serving infrastructure"
- ✗ "Infrastructure gaps exist" (obscures why)

**Challenge, don't just accommodate**:
- ✓ "Design accessible from the start" (universal design)
- ✗ "We'll add accessibility later" (accommodation model)

**Everyone is welcome**: Write assuming your audience includes people of all backgrounds, abilities, and experiences. Default to inclusion, not exceptions.

---

## XV. CROSS-LINGUISTIC AND GLOBAL ACCESSIBILITY

### Writing for Translation and International Audiences

Many executives operate globally or serve multilingual communities. Even domestic US institutions serve students, staff, and stakeholders who speak Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, and dozens of other languages.

**Core principles**:
1. **Use literal language** - Avoid idioms and metaphors
2. **Simple sentence structure** - One idea per sentence, active voice
3. **No cultural assumptions** - Not everyone shares US business culture references

### Idioms to Avoid (With Clear Alternatives)

**Business idioms that don't translate**:
- ✗ "Low-hanging fruit" → ✓ "Easy initial improvements" or "Quick wins"
- ✗ "Move the needle" → ✓ "Create measurable impact"
- ✗ "Game-changer" → ✓ "Significant improvement"
- ✗ "Take it to the next level" → ✓ "Improve significantly"
- ✗ "Think outside the box" → ✓ "Consider non-traditional approaches"
- ✗ "Ballpark figure" → ✓ "Rough estimate"
- ✗ "Touch base" → ✓ "Follow up" or "Connect"
- ✗ "Circle back" → ✓ "Return to this topic"

**Why this matters**: Machine translation (Google Translate, DeepL) translates idioms literally, creating nonsense. "Low-hanging fruit" becomes references to actual fruit. Clear, direct language translates accurately.

### Writing for Machine Translation

**Good for translation**:
> "This approach requires $2-5M investment over 18 months but reduces security incidents by 60%."

**Poor for translation** (idioms, complex structure):
> "We need to get ahead of this before it snowballs—let's tackle the low-hanging fruit and move the needle on security."

**Test your writing**: Run important communications through Google Translate to another language and back. If meaning changes significantly, simplify.

### International Conventions

**Dates**: Use ISO 8601 (2025-11-24) or spell out (24 November 2025), not ambiguous 11/24/2025

**Currency**: Always specify (US$1M, €2M, £500K), not just "$"

**Measurements**: Provide metric with or instead of imperial when serving international audiences

---

## Conclusion: Writing for Executive Impact

Writing for IT executives requires **disciplined prioritization of strategic value over comprehensive coverage**. Every paragraph must answer the executive's core questions: "Why does this matter to our institution? What should we do? What will it cost? What happens if we don't?"

**Core principles for executive writing**:
1. **Respect their time**: Be concise, scannable, and decision-focused
2. **Speak their language**: Business impact, risk, resource requirements, competitive positioning
3. **Enable decisions**: Clear recommendations with trade-offs and alternatives
4. **Quantify relentlessly**: Costs, timelines, benefits, risks in specific terms
5. **Stay strategic**: Architecture and portfolio level, not implementation details
6. **Acknowledge governance**: Board accountability, fiduciary responsibility, oversight needs

Tom Jordan's practitioner-educator voice adapts well to executive audiences because it already emphasizes **frameworks over tactics**, **acknowledgment of complexity**, and **pragmatic realism**. The adaptation intensifies these qualities while compressing delivery and elevating business framing.

**The executive version of your voice is**: The strategic technology advisor who translates complex infrastructure decisions into clear business choices, respects leadership time, quantifies impact rigorously, and provides confident counsel while acknowledging uncertainty.
