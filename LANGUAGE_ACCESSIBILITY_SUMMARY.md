# Language Accessibility Review - Summary

**Date**: November 24, 2025
**Frameworks Applied**:
- Anti-Oppressive Language (anti-racist, anti-classist, anti-sexist, anti-ableist)
- Cross-Linguistic Accessibility (translation-friendly, culturally neutral)

---

## Work Completed

### 1. ✅ Anti-Oppressive Language Framework
**File**: `ANTI_OPPRESSIVE_LANGUAGE_ADDITIONS.md`

Created comprehensive framework for actively challenging systems of oppression including:
- Centering marginalized voices and knowledge
- Challenging white supremacy and colonialism
- Challenging classism
- Challenging sexism and patriarchy
- Challenging ableism
- Intersectionality framework
- Self-reflection questions for writers
- Audience-specific anti-oppression guidance

### 2. ✅ Inclusive Language Review
**File**: `INCLUSIVE_LANGUAGE_REVIEW.md`

Conducted detailed review finding:
- **Issues found**: 2 instances of problematic language ("elderly," "illiterate")
- **Fixes applied**: Changed to "based on age or literacy background" and "multiple communication formats"
- **Overall assessment**: Strong foundation with good gender-neutral language, cultural respect, emphasis on agency

### 3. ✅ Cross-Linguistic Style Guide
**File**: `CROSS_LINGUISTIC_STYLE_GUIDE.md`

Created comprehensive guide for translation-friendly writing including:
- 100+ idioms to avoid with clear alternatives
- Guidance on avoiding culturally-specific contexts
- Sentence structure for machine translation
- Vocabulary choices for international English
- How to avoid phrasal verbs
- International date/number/measurement formats
- Testing procedures using machine translation
- Language justice as anti-oppression practice

### 4. ✅ Fixed Idioms in Base Style Guide
**File**: `STYLE.md`

Removed idioms found:
- ❌ "jump ship" → ✅ "leave for other opportunities"
- ❌ "through its paces" → ✅ "test thoroughly"
- ❌ "put the same rigor" → ✅ "maintain the same standards"

## Key Principles Established

### Anti-Oppressive Writing
1. **Center marginalized voices** - Not just include, but lead with
2. **Name systems of oppression** - Explicitly call out racism, classism, ableism
3. **Challenge power structures** - Question who has authority in our writing
4. **Default to universal inclusion** - Everyone included, no one set apart
5. **Intersectional analysis** - Recognize compounded oppressions

### Cross-Linguistic Writing
1. **Write literally** - No idioms, metaphors, or figurative language
2. **Simple sentence structure** - One idea per sentence, active voice
3. **Avoid cultural specificity** - No Western-centric references
4. **Standard vocabulary** - International English, not regional dialects
5. **Test with machine translation** - Verify clarity across languages

## Implementation Status

### Completed:
- [x] Created anti-oppressive language framework
- [x] Conducted inclusive language review
- [x] Fixed problematic age/literacy language (1 instance)
- [x] Created comprehensive cross-linguistic guide
- [x] Removed idioms from base STYLE.md (3 instances)

### Ready to Implement:
- [ ] Add anti-oppressive framework section to all 6 audience guides
- [ ] Add cross-linguistic section to all 6 audience guides
- [ ] Update example transformations with anti-oppressive framing
- [ ] Add self-reflection questions to each guide

---

## Next Steps - Your Decision

### Option 1: Integrate Into All Style Guides (Recommended)

Add two new sections to each of the six audience-specific guides:

**Section to add: "Anti-Oppressive Language Framework"**
- Audience-specific anti-oppression guidance
- Self-reflection questions
- Examples of challenging power structures
- Language for centering marginalized voices

**Section to add: "Cross-Linguistic Accessibility"**
- Translation-friendly writing principles
- Idioms to avoid (audience-specific examples)
- Sentence structure guidance
- Testing procedures

**Time estimate**: ~2 hours to integrate into all six guides with audience-specific adaptations

### Option 2: Keep as Reference Documents

Use the three framework documents as reference when writing:
- ANTI_OPPRESSIVE_LANGUAGE_ADDITIONS.md
- CROSS_LINGUISTIC_STYLE_GUIDE.md
- INCLUSIVE_LANGUAGE_REVIEW.md

**Benefit**: Less overhead in style guides
**Drawback**: Writers might not reference them consistently

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Add abbreviated versions to audience guides with links to full frameworks.

**Example**: Each guide gets a 1-page summary of key principles with "See CROSS_LINGUISTIC_STYLE_GUIDE.md for full guidance"

## Impact Assessment

### Anti-Oppressive Framework Impact

**What it changes**:
- Writing explicitly challenges racism, classism, sexism, ableism
- Centers community voices, not external "experts"
- Questions assumptions about who is "normal"
- Names systems of oppression when discussing barriers

**Example transformation**:

**Before**: "We will build local capacity to implement technology solutions."

**After**: "Community technical leaders will guide implementation, with external support transitioning out as they determine. We acknowledge our role as guests learning from communities who have context expertise we lack."

### Cross-Linguistic Framework Impact

**What it changes**:
- All writing works across languages via machine translation
- No culturally-specific idioms or metaphors
- Clear, literal language
- International examples and contexts

**Example transformation**:

**Before**: "Let's tackle the low-hanging fruit before we try to boil the ocean. Circle back with me tomorrow to touch base on progress."

**After**: "Let's address the easiest improvements first before attempting larger changes. Meet with me tomorrow to discuss progress."

## Audience-Specific Considerations

### IT Executives
- **Anti-oppression**: Equity in technology investment decisions; who benefits/who is harmed
- **Cross-linguistic**: Global operations; international CIO audiences

### IT Technical
- **Anti-oppression**: Technology as liberation or oppression; open source vs proprietary
- **Cross-linguistic**: International developer teams; documentation translation

### Academic/University
- **Anti-oppression**: Epistemic justice; whose knowledge counts; multilingual learning
- **Cross-linguistic**: International students/faculty; research collaboration

### Humanitarian Executive
- **Anti-oppression**: Power/positionality; anti-colonialism; community leadership
- **Cross-linguistic**: **CRITICAL** - Field staff across languages; real-time translation

### Humanitarian Program Leadership
- **Anti-oppression**: Local partnership primacy; external support not external control
- **Cross-linguistic**: **CRITICAL** - Operational guidance translated in field

### Humanitarian Technical
- **Anti-oppression**: Technology transfer not dependency; local data sovereignty
- **Cross-linguistic**: **CRITICAL** - Technical docs translated; clear instructions life-saving

## Cross-Linguistic: Especially Critical for Humanitarian Work

Your humanitarian deployments span:
- **Hurricane Beryl, Grenada**: English/Creole context
- **Ebola #16, DRC**: French, Lingala, Swahili context
- **Hurricanes Helene/Milton, US**: English but multilingual communities (Spanish, Creole, others)

**Impact**: Clear, translation-friendly writing is not just good practice—it's **operational necessity** and **safety issue**.

**Example scenario**:
Field team in DRC using Google Translate to understand technical guidance. Idiom "tackle the problem before it snowballs" translates literally to "face this before it becomes a snowball" (nonsense). Clear alternative "address this problem before it grows larger" translates accurately.

## Linguistic Justice as Anti-Oppression

**Cross-linguistic accessibility IS anti-oppressive practice**:

1. **Challenges English dominance** - Recognizes English is one of many languages
2. **Reduces barriers** - More people can access information
3. **Centers non-English speakers** - Writes for their comprehension, not native English speakers' style
4. **Respects local languages** - Acknowledges they should be primary
5. **Distributes power** - Information accessibility = empowerment

**Quote from framework**:
> "Requiring fluent English excludes many brilliant people. Translation costs shouldn't be barrier to participation. Local languages should be primary in local contexts."

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Already Done):
1. ✅ Fix problematic language found in review
2. ✅ Remove idioms from base style guide
3. ✅ Create comprehensive frameworks

### Next Steps (Awaiting Your Direction):

**Phase 1: Integrate Anti-Oppressive Framework**
- Add "Anti-Oppressive Language" section to all 6 guides
- Include audience-specific self-reflection questions
- Update example transformations

**Phase 2: Integrate Cross-Linguistic Framework**
- Add "Cross-Linguistic Accessibility" section to all 6 guides
- List audience-specific idioms to avoid
- Include testing procedures

**Phase 3: Examples and Validation**
- Update all example transformations with both frameworks
- Create before/after showing anti-oppressive AND cross-linguistic improvements
- Add validation checklists

---

## Summary

You now have:
- ✅ **Comprehensive anti-oppressive framework** (actively anti-racist, anti-classist, anti-sexist, anti-ableist)
- ✅ **Comprehensive cross-linguistic framework** (translation-friendly, culturally neutral, internationally accessible)
- ✅ **Fixed issues** in existing style guides
- ✅ **Ready-to-integrate** sections for all six audience guides

These frameworks ensure your writing:
1. **Challenges oppression** rather than just avoiding exclusion
2. **Works across languages** for your global humanitarian and IT work
3. **Centers marginalized communities** rather than external experts
4. **Respects linguistic diversity** as anti-colonial practice

**Your writing will be more accessible, more just, and more effective across all the contexts you work in.**
