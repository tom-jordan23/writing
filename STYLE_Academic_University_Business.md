## V. ACADEMIC MISSION INTEGRATION

### Connecting to Student Success

**Student-focused framing**:
> "First-generation and underrepresented students often face barriers to technology access that limit their ability to fully participate in the academic experience. By providing secure, reliable connectivity in residence halls and across campus, we remove obstacles to student engagement and create equitable opportunities for success. Institutions with comprehensive connectivity report higher student satisfaction and improved retention rates, particularly among students from underresourced backgrounds."

**What makes this effective**:
- Centers student experience and equity
- Connects infrastructure to retention (key institutional metric)
- Cites evidence from peer institutions
- Frames technology as access and opportunity

### Connecting to Research Excellence

**Research-focused framing**:
> "Faculty researchers across disciplines—from computational chemistry to digital humanities—increasingly require infrastructure that supports data-intensive methodologies. Current storage limitations force researchers to delay analysis or reduce sample sizes, constraining scholarly productivity and federal grant competitiveness. Enhanced research computing infrastructure positions our faculty to pursue ambitious projects and strengthens our standing among research universities. Michigan and Illinois report that research infrastructure investments correlate with increased federal funding and cross-disciplinary collaboration."

**What makes this effective**:

> "Faculty members are exploring innovative pedagogical approaches—from hybrid and flipped classrooms to experiential learning and global virtual collaboration—that require flexible, reliable technology infrastructure. Supporting pedagogical innovation while respecting instructional autonomy requires infrastructure that adapts to diverse teaching styles rather than imposing one-size-fits-all solutions. Our approach prioritizes faculty choice and disciplinary appropriateness while ensuring students have consistent access to learning tools."

**What makes this effective**:
- Respects faculty autonomy and expertise
- Acknowledges pedagogical diversity
- Frames technology as supporting choice, not constraining it
- Student access emphasized

---

## VI. GOVERNANCE AND PROCESS INTEGRATION

### Shared Governance Language

**Committee and consultation framing**:
> "This proposal will be presented to the IT Governance Committee for review in October, with the goal of bringing a recommendation to Faculty Senate in December. We welcome input from academic departments and are scheduling consultation sessions with college-level IT committees throughout the fall. The timeline allows for thorough consideration while positioning us for summer implementation that minimizes disruption to instruction."

**Phased and pilot approaches**:
> "Rather than campus-wide implementation, we propose a pilot program with the College of Letters & Science during the spring semester. This approach allows us to refine the process with faculty feedback, assess impact on student learning, and adapt the approach before broader deployment. Pilot participants will inform best practices and help us understand disciplinary variations in needs."

### Academic Calendar Sensitivity

**Timeline considerations**:
- "Summer implementation minimizes disruption to instruction"
- "Following spring semester completion..."
- "Between academic terms..."
- "Avoiding mid-semester changes..."
- "After grades are submitted..."

**Process timelines**:
- Acknowledge deliberative process takes time
- Build in feedback and iteration cycles
- Respect committee meeting schedules
- Account for academic year cycles

- Non-traditional students, adult learners, online/hybrid programs
- Community partnerships, applied research, student success initiatives

---

## IX. ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION FRAMING

### Academic Assessment Language

**Outcomes-focused**:
> "We will assess this initiative using established frameworks for technology impact on learning outcomes. Assessment measures include student satisfaction surveys, faculty feedback through focus groups, usage analytics for learning platforms, and comparative analysis of student success metrics (retention, course completion, GPA) between pilot participants and control groups. The assessment design aligns with institutional effectiveness protocols and has been reviewed by the Assessment Council."

**What makes this effective**:
- Uses academic assessment language
- Multiple data sources (triangulation)
- Compares to control groups (research design)
- Ties to institutional assessment infrastructure
- Mentions governance review (Assessment Council)

### Continuous Improvement

**Iterative approach**:
> "Following educational technology best practices, we will review pilot outcomes at semester close, incorporate faculty feedback into refinements, and adjust the approach before expanding to additional colleges. This iterative process ensures the solution remains responsive to actual faculty and student needs rather than theoretical design assumptions."

---

## X. EQUITY AND ACCESS INTEGRATION

### Student Equity Framing

**Access and equity**:
> "Technology infrastructure can either reduce or exacerbate equity gaps in student success. First-generation students, students from rural backgrounds, and students with disabilities often face disproportionate technology barriers. Our approach prioritizes universal design principles and equitable access, ensuring all students can participate fully regardless of their prior technology exposure or resources. This aligns with our institutional commitment to inclusive excellence and closing achievement gaps."

**What makes this effective**:
- Names specific student populations
- Acknowledges infrastructure can harm or help equity
- References universal design (established framework)
- Connects to institutional values and strategic priorities
- Uses academic diversity language (inclusive excellence)

---

## XI. EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS

### Base Style (IT Professional Audience):
> "Zero-trust architecture acknowledges that infiltration points don't determine ultimate targets—once inside a network, threat actors tend to move laterally. Traditional network security models, which assume internal users and devices are inherently trustworthy, cannot adequately protect organizations anymore."

### Academic/University Business Adaptation:
> "Protecting the confidentiality of research data and student information while maintaining the open, collaborative environment essential to academic work presents a persistent challenge. Traditional campus network approaches assumed that anyone with physical presence could be trusted—an assumption no longer viable given increasing cybersecurity threats and regulatory requirements for data protection. Enhanced security approaches can protect sensitive research and student data while preserving the accessibility faculty and students expect. Peer institutions including Michigan and Northwestern have successfully implemented modern security frameworks that maintain academic values while meeting compliance obligations."

**What changed**:
- Technical term ("zero-trust") removed; concept explained in mission terms
- Opens with academic values (open, collaborative environment)
- Emphasizes research and student data (mission-critical assets)
- Acknowledges tension between security and academic culture
- References peer institutions by name (crucial for academic audiences)
- Frames as protecting academic values, not just implementing security
- Compliance mentioned but not primary driver

## Conclusion: Writing for Academic Mission

Writing for academic and university business audiences requires **deep respect for shared governance**, **mission-first framing**, and **collaborative problem-solving**. Technology must always be positioned as serving the academic enterprise—supporting scholarship, enabling teaching, and advancing student success.

**Core principles for academic writing**:
1. **Mission first**: Always foreground student success, research excellence, or teaching innovation
2. **Respect governance**: Acknowledge shared decision-making and invite collaboration
3. **Evidence-based**: Use peer institution examples and educational research
4. **Culturally aware**: Understand academic values, tenure, disciplinary diversity
5. **Equity-conscious**: Address access and inclusive excellence
6. **Deliberative**: Respect the need for thorough consideration and iterative refinement
7. **Humble service**: Technology serves academics; academics don't serve technology

Tom Jordan's practitioner-educator voice adapts exceptionally well to academic audiences because it already emphasizes **frameworks over tools**, **acknowledgment of complexity**, **pragmatic approaches**, and **respect for people and organizational culture**. The adaptation intensifies mission focus and collaborative invitation while maintaining the evidence-based, structured approach.

**The academic version of your voice is**: The academic colleague with technology expertise who serves the institutional mission, respects faculty autonomy and shared governance, grounds recommendations in peer institution evidence, and invites collaborative problem-solving in support of student success and scholarly excellence.

## XIV. HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND FOUNDATIONAL THINKING

### A Gentle Historical Awareness

*This section is completely optional enrichment. You don't need to know any of this history to write excellent communications for academic audiences. But connecting current practice to the rich history of higher education can sometimes deepen our understanding and strengthen our commitment to academic values.*

Universities are among humanity's oldest institutions—continuous communities of learning spanning centuries. When we work in higher education, we're part of a tradition that stretches back to medieval universities, to classical academies, to ancient schools of philosophy. The values we hold—academic freedom, pursuit of truth, open inquiry, peer review—weren't invented yesterday. They emerged from generations of scholars creating spaces where ideas could be examined without fear.

**Consider these connections** (when relevant and meaningful):

- **The liberal arts tradition** emphasized seven core disciplines (grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy) as foundations for free citizens to participate fully in society. Today's general education requirements and breadth requirements echo this commitment to well-rounded education, not just technical training. Technology should serve this broad educational mission, not narrow it.

- **Medieval universities** (Bologna 1088, Oxford 1096, Paris 1150) established principles we still honor: faculty self-governance, academic freedom to pursue controversial ideas, peer communities of scholars, degrees awarded by faculty judgment. When we respect shared governance today, we're practicing an 900-year-old tradition of faculty authority over academic matters.

- **Land-grant mission** (Morrill Acts, 1862 and 1890) expanded higher education beyond elites to serve practical needs of working people—agriculture, engineering, teaching. This democratizing mission—that higher education serves everyone, not just the wealthy—shapes public university values today. Technology decisions either advance or undermine this mission of access and service.

- **GI Bill** (1944) fundamentally transformed American higher education by making college accessible to returning veterans regardless of background. This expansion brought first-generation college students, working-class students, and diverse perspectives into universities. Our commitment to inclusive excellence builds on this history of expanding access.

These aren't abstract historical facts—they're the foundation of why universities exist and how they operate. When we preserve academic freedom, we're honoring centuries of scholars who created spaces for dangerous ideas. When we practice shared governance, we're continuing a medieval tradition of faculty self-determination. When we prioritize access and equity, we're advancing a land-grant mission of education serving democracy.

**For the Stoically inclined** (completely optional):

The Stoic philosophers were educators, and their principles offer wisdom for academic work:

- **Dichotomy of control** (Epictetus): We control our teaching preparation, our scholarly rigor, our service to students. We don't control enrollment numbers, state budgets, or external pressures. Focus energy where we have agency—in the classroom, in our research, in our community of colleagues.

- **Amor fati** (Marcus Aurelius): Budget cuts, enrollment challenges, and institutional pressures are inevitable. Embrace them as opportunities to clarify mission and values. The best teaching often emerges from constraint, not abundance.

- **Premeditatio malorum** (Seneca): What if enrollment drops? What if funding cuts? What if technology fails mid-lecture? By imagining scenarios, we prepare better and reduce anxiety. Every experienced teacher has backup plans—this is Stoic practice.

- **Sympatheia** (interconnection): Students, colleagues, staff, community—we're all connected. A librarian's work enables a researcher's scholarship. An IT professional's infrastructure supports a teacher's pedagogy. A student's question deepens everyone's understanding. Academic community is Stoic interconnection embodied.

- **The four virtues in teaching**: Wisdom (mastering our fields and pedagogy), Courage (supporting students through failure, pursuing unpopular research), Justice (treating all students equitably, honoring community), Temperance (sustainable work practices, balanced lives). These ancient virtues describe excellent teaching and scholarship.

Marcus Aurelius was Roman Emperor, but his *Meditations* were private notes on how to be good at his job and good to people despite immense pressure. Every academic under deadline pressure or facing a difficult class knows this challenge. Epictetus was a formerly enslaved person who taught that external circumstances don't determine our character—only our responses do. First-generation students navigating unfamiliar academic culture embody this wisdom daily.

## XV. ANTI-OPPRESSIVE LANGUAGE AND EPISTEMIC JUSTICE

### Whose Knowledge Counts?

Universities claim to pursue truth and create knowledge. But whose knowledge gets valued? Whose ways of knowing count as legitimate? These aren't abstract philosophical questions—they shape whose voices get heard, whose research gets funded, whose students succeed.

**Epistemic justice** means recognizing that knowledge comes from many sources, not just dominant groups. Universities have historically centered white, Western, male, upper-class ways of knowing while marginalizing or dismissing Indigenous knowledge, women's scholarship, working-class perspectives, non-Western epistemologies, and knowledge from disabled people.

**Questions for academic communication:**

**Whose knowledge do we cite and elevate?**
- Do our references include scholars from marginalized communities?
- Do we cite women, BIPOC scholars, international researchers, disabled scholars?
- Do we privilege certain journals/presses while dismissing others?
- Do we value community knowledge alongside academic expertise?

**Whose ways of knowing do we legitimize?**
- Do we only value quantitative research, or also qualitative and community-based?
- Do we recognize Indigenous knowledge systems, oral traditions, experiential knowledge?
- Do we honor diverse disciplinary epistemologies (sciences, humanities, arts)?
- Do we create space for students to bring their lived experience as valid knowledge?

**Who gets to participate in knowledge creation?**
- Do our academic spaces welcome first-generation students, working-class students?
- Do we assume prior cultural capital (knowing unwritten rules of academia)?
- Are our events accessible to disabled students/faculty/staff?
- Do we accommodate different learning styles, communication preferences, cognitive diversity?

**Whose language is "legitimate"?**
- Do we require "standard academic English" that excludes multilingual scholars, dialect speakers?
- Do we value linguistic diversity in multilingual students, or frame it as deficit?
- Do we accommodate communication disabilities (stuttering, selective mutism, aphasia)?
- Do we recognize that "professional communication" often encodes white, Western, male norms?

### Examples in Academic Practice

**Syllabi and course policies:**
- ❌ "All assignments must use standard academic English" → excludes dialect speakers, multilingual students, students with language disabilities
- ✅ "Communicate clearly in ways that work for you; we'll work together on genre conventions for different audiences" → welcomes linguistic diversity while teaching when formal academic style is needed

**Research and scholarship:**
- ❌ "Literature review covers major journals" (which are mostly white, Western, male-dominated)
- ✅ "Literature review includes diverse scholarly perspectives, community-based research, and international scholarship" → epistemic justice in citation practices

**Student evaluation:**
- ❌ "Class participation" (privileges extroverts, native English speakers, students from debate-culture backgrounds)
- ✅ "Multiple ways to demonstrate engagement: speaking, writing, small groups, online discussion, office hours" → accommodates cognitive and cultural diversity

**Committee work:**
- ❌ "We'll find the best candidate" (often reproduces existing demographics through biased "merit" definitions)
- ✅ "We'll actively recruit diverse candidates and examine our evaluation criteria for hidden bias" → acknowledges that "best" depends on what we value

### First-Generation and Working-Class Student Access

Academic culture has unwritten rules that advantage students from educated families. First-generation students face barriers that aren't about intelligence or motivation—they're about not knowing the hidden curriculum.

**Anti-oppressive practice for first-gen students:**
- Make expectations explicit (don't assume they know "how to do office hours" or "what a literature review is")
- Explain academic jargon and conventions
- Acknowledge that working while studying is valid (not "lack of commitment")
- Recognize food/housing insecurity as systemic issues, not individual failures
- Provide multiple pathways to success (not just the traditional 4-year residential model)

### Accessibility as Justice, Not Accommodation

Accessibility isn't doing favors for disabled people—it's designing systems that don't disable people in the first place. The "accommodation" model treats disability as individual medical problem. The justice model recognizes that environments disable people through barriers.

**Universal design in academic communication:**
- Provide materials in multiple formats (text, audio, video with captions)
- Use plain language (benefits everyone, required for some)
- Structure information clearly with headers and lists
- Describe visual information (accessible to screen readers, helpful for everyone)
- Allow flexible deadlines and formats (serves mental health, chronic illness, family responsibilities)

### Writing with Anti-Oppressive Awareness

**Center marginalized voices:**
- Feature research by BIPOC scholars, women, disabled scholars, international researchers
- Quote students from underrepresented backgrounds about their experiences
- Highlight initiatives led by marginalized communities, not just "serving" them
- Acknowledge when our perspective is limited by our social location

**Challenge academic gatekeeping:**
- "Rigorous" often means "exclusionary" (who gets to define rigor?)
- "High standards" can maintain white supremacy (whose standards?)
- "Meritocracy" ignores unequal starting points and systemic barriers
- "Academic excellence" has often meant "most like existing faculty"

**Name systems and power:**
- White supremacy in higher education (not just "lack of diversity")
- Classism in academic culture (not just "first-gen support needs")
- Ableism in pedagogy (not just "accommodations")
- Colonialism in curricula (whose knowledge dominates?)

**Use inclusive language:**
- "They/them" for individuals when gender unknown
- "People with disabilities" or "disabled people" (both acceptable; ask preference)
- "Undocumented students" not "illegal aliens"
- "First-generation students" not "disadvantaged students" (frames strength, not deficit)
- "Students who work" not "working students" (work is what they do, not who they are)

## XVI. CROSS-LINGUISTIC AND GLOBAL ACCESSIBILITY

### Writing for Global Higher Education Communities

Higher education is increasingly global—international students, international faculty, global research collaborations, students studying abroad, online programs crossing borders. When we write clearly for machine translation, we make our academic communications accessible to the global scholarly community.

**This is especially critical for international students and scholars** who bring invaluable perspectives but may face language barriers. Clear, translation-friendly writing is not "dumbing down"—it's recognizing that complex ideas can be expressed clearly, and that linguistic accessibility enables broader participation in academic community.

### Writing for Translation and International Audiences

**Clear, literal academic language:**
- One main idea per sentence (complexity through clarity, not convoluted syntax)
- Active voice ("Faculty approved the policy" not "The policy was approved")
- Specific verbs ("modify" not "tweak," "investigate" not "look into")
- Standard academic English (international English, not regional idioms)

**Avoid idioms that don't translate:**
- ❌ "Let's level the playing field for students" → ✅ "Let's create equitable opportunities for all students"
- ❌ "This research is game-changing" → ✅ "This research significantly advances the field"
- ❌ "Think outside the box" → ✅ "Consider unconventional approaches"
- ❌ "Low-hanging fruit in our strategic plan" → ✅ "Easily achievable goals in our strategic plan"

**Avoid culturally-specific references:**
- ❌ "Home run for student success" (baseball metaphor) → ✅ "Significant achievement in student success"
- ❌ "Fourth-quarter push" (American football) → ✅ "Final intensive effort"
- ❌ "Monday-morning quarterbacking" → ✅ "Analyzing decisions after the outcome is known"

**Academic idioms to avoid:**

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Unpack this concept" | "Examine this concept in detail" or "analyze this concept" |
| "Deep dive into the research" | "Thorough examination of the research" |
| "Push the envelope" | "Expand boundaries" or "attempt innovative approaches" |
| "Paradigm shift" (overused, vague) | Be specific about what changed and how |
| "Drinking from a firehose" | "Receiving large amounts of information quickly" |
| "Move the needle" | "Create measurable improvement" |
| "Take offline" | "Discuss separately" or "continue this conversation later" |

### Writing for Machine Translation

**Test important communications** using translation services:

1. Translate to 2-3 languages relevant to your international community (Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, etc.)
2. Translate back to English
3. Check if meaning preserved, especially key academic concepts
4. Revise sentences that translate poorly

**Good for translation:**
> "Faculty governance committees will review this proposal during the fall semester. We invite input from all academic departments. The final decision will be made by Faculty Senate in December."

**Translates poorly:**
> "We'll run this up the flagpole with faculty governance this fall. Departments should weigh in. Senate will give it the green light or red light in December."

### International Conventions in Academic Writing

**Dates:** Spell out month to avoid US/international confusion
- ✅ "November 24, 2025" or "24 November 2025"
- ❌ "11/24/25" (US) vs "24/11/25" (international)—creates confusion

**Times:** Specify timezone when relevant
- ✅ "Meeting at 14:00 UTC" or "2:00 PM Central Time (US)"
- ❌ "Meeting at 2 PM" (which timezone?)

**Academic terms:**
- Explain US-specific terms: "tenure-track" (permanent faculty position after probationary period), "liberal arts" (broad general education), "GPA" (grade point average)
- Define abbreviations: "FERPA" not just letters
- Recognize international variations: "module" vs "course," "programme" vs "program"

**Cultural references in examples:**
- Include diverse examples (not just US contexts)
- Reference international scholarly communities
- Acknowledge different higher education systems
- Use global cities/contexts, not just American

### Language Justice in Academia

**Linguistic accessibility is academic justice:**
- English dominance in academia excludes brilliant scholars
- Multilingual scholarship enriches understanding
- Translation costs shouldn't prevent participation
- Local languages should be honored in international contexts

**Multilingual students as assets:**
- Students who speak multiple languages bring cognitive flexibility
- Translating complex concepts requires deep understanding
- Code-switching is sophisticated linguistic skill
- "Accent" represents additional language mastery, not deficit

**When we write clearly for machine translation, we:**
- Enable international students to access information
- Support international faculty and visiting scholars
- Facilitate global research collaboration
- Honor linguistic diversity in academic community
- Make scholarship more globally accessible

### Academic Writing That Crosses Borders

**Good practices for global academic communication:**
- Define acronyms and institution-specific terms
- Provide context for US-specific policies/practices
- Include international examples and perspectives
- Test with international colleagues when possible
- Use clear, direct language (sophisticated ideas, accessible prose)

## FINAL INTEGRATION: Academic Communication That Welcomes Everyone

The best academic writing is:
- **Mission-focused** (serves student success, research excellence, teaching innovation)
- **Collaborative and respectful** (honors shared governance and faculty expertise)
- **Epistemically just** (recognizes diverse ways of knowing)
- **Linguistically accessible** (works across languages and cultural contexts)
- **Connected to tradition** (honors the deep history of higher education values)
- **Warm and human** (remembers that behind every email is a person, behind every policy are students and colleagues)

You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to know every historical detail or anticipate every accessibility need. But being aware of these dimensions—historical foundations, epistemic justice, linguistic accessibility—makes us better academic colleagues and more thoughtful members of our university communities.

Everyone is welcome in the academic community. Every student brings valuable knowledge. Every colleague contributes. Let's communicate in ways that honor that truth.

**In the words of Epictetus** (completely optional, but I love this):
> "What then is education? Education is the realization that nothing that happens to you is terrible, unbearable, catastrophic. Nothing that happens to you gives you an excuse to be cruel to others."

For students facing imposter syndrome, for faculty facing impossible pressures, for staff managing crises—this Stoic wisdom offers compassion. Our academic communications can embody this: acknowledging difficulty while affirming agency, respecting struggle while offering support, maintaining standards while welcoming everyone.
