# Inclusive Language Review: Style Guides Analysis
## Actively Anti-Racist, Anti-Classist, Anti-Sexist Framework

**Date**: November 24, 2025
**Reviewer**: Claude (AI Assistant)
**Scope**: All six audience-specific style guides
**Framework**: Not just inclusive—actively working against systems of oppression

---

## Executive Summary

I conducted a comprehensive review of all six style guides through an **actively anti-oppressive lens**. This goes beyond avoiding exclusionary language to **actively challenging racism, classism, sexism, ableism, and other systems of oppression** in how we write and who we center.

**Overall assessment: Strong foundation; requires deeper anti-oppressive strengthening.**

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Consistent use of gender-neutral language throughout (they/them, not he/she)
- ✅ No gendered job titles (uses "staffers," "professionals," "teams")
- ✅ Respectful of cultural diversity and local knowledge
- ✅ Emphasizes community participation and agency
- ✅ Focus on barriers/systems rather than individual deficits
- ✅ Strong emphasis on dignity and empowerment

**Areas for improvement**:
- ⚠️ Two instances of potentially problematic age/literacy language
- ⚠️ Consider alternatives to some standard humanitarian terminology
- ⚠️ Add explicit inclusive language guidance to style guides

## Detailed Findings by Category

### 1. Age-Related Language

**Issue Found** (STYLE_Humanitarian_Executive.md:330):
> "digital exclusion of **elderly** and illiterate community members"

**Concern**: "Elderly" can be perceived as patronizing or othering.

**Recommended change**:
- ✓ "older adults" or "older people"
- ✓ Or focus on the solution: "people of all ages"

**Alternative framing** (solution-focused, not age-focused):
> "digital exclusion based on age or literacy" → "ensuring accessibility across all ages and literacy levels"

---

### 2. Literacy Language

**Issue Found** (Same location as above):
> "digital exclusion of elderly and **illiterate** community members"

**Concern**: "Illiterate" is deficit-based framing that defines people by what they cannot do.

**Recommended changes**:
- ✓ "people who communicate in non-written formats"
- ✓ "people who use oral communication"
- ✓ "people with diverse literacy backgrounds"
- ✓ Or remove the label entirely and focus on solution: "parallel paper-based and oral communication systems"

**Better example already in guides** (STYLE_Humanitarian_Executive.md:147):
> "accessible via basic mobile phones—can provide timely, accurate information while **respecting literacy levels** and language diversity"

This is good because it:
- Uses neutral "literacy levels" not "illiterate"
- Frames as something to respect, not a problem to solve
- Focuses on solution (accessible via mobile phones)

---

### 3. Humanitarian Terminology: "Vulnerable Populations"

**Frequency**: Used 14 times across humanitarian guides

**Examples**:
- "serving vulnerable populations"
- "protection of vulnerable groups"
- "vulnerable population inclusion"

**Analysis**: This is standard humanitarian sector terminology found in Core Humanitarian Standard, Sphere, and all major humanitarian frameworks.

**Considerations**:
- ✓ **Keep if**: Used to describe temporary situation (people in crisis, displacement, disaster zones)
- ⚠️ **Consider alternatives if**: Implies inherent weakness rather than situational vulnerability
- ✓ **Current usage is appropriate**: Your guides use it correctly—referring to people in crisis situations, not inherent characteristics

**Alternatives to consider** (context-dependent):
- "people in crisis situations"
- "people affected by [specific event]"
- "displaced populations"
- "communities experiencing [specific challenge]"
- "people we serve"

**Recommendation**: Current usage is appropriate and aligns with humanitarian standards. No change required, but authors should be mindful that vulnerability is situational, not inherent.

---

### 4. "Beneficiary" Language

**Frequency**: 38 occurrences in STYLE_Humanitarian_Executive.md

**Analysis**: "Beneficiary" is standard humanitarian terminology but has been critiqued for:
- Implying passive receipt of aid
- Creating power dynamic (giver/receiver)
- Not acknowledging agency

**Current practice varies by organization**:
- **Traditional**: beneficiary, target population
- **Participatory**: participant, community member
- **Rights-based**: rights-holder, person affected
- **Neutral**: people we serve, communities we work with

**Recommendation**:
- **Keep "beneficiary" in style guides** (it's current standard terminology)
- **Add guidance** on when to use alternatives:
  - Use "participants" when emphasizing active involvement
  - Use "community members" when emphasizing local ownership
  - Use "affected populations" when emphasizing shared experience of crisis
  - Use "people/families/communities" when possible to center humanity

---

### 5. Disability Language

**Finding**: No problematic disability language found.

**Good practices observed**:
- Uses "people with disabilities" (person-first language)
- Includes disability in diversity considerations
- Universal design principles implied in accessibility guidance

**Recommendation**: Add explicit guidance:

```markdown
**Disability and accessibility language**:
- ✓ "person with a disability" or "disabled person" (both acceptable; some prefer identity-first)
- ✗ "wheelchair-bound," "confined to a wheelchair" → ✓ "wheelchair user"
- ✗ "suffers from," "victim of," "afflicted with" → ✓ "person with [condition]"
- ✗ "handicapped" → ✓ "accessible" (e.g., "accessible parking" not "handicapped parking")
- ✓ Focus on barriers, not deficits: "inaccessible building" not "people who can't access"
```

---

### 6. Cultural and Geographic Bias

**Finding**: Generally good, but check for Western-centrism.

**Good practices observed**:
- Emphasizes local knowledge and capacity
- "Context-appropriate" used frequently
- Cultural adaptation emphasized
- Local partnership primacy

**Areas to strengthen**:

**Technology assumptions**:
- Current guides appropriately acknowledge diverse technology contexts
- Good example: "basic mobile phones" not assuming smartphones

**Infrastructure assumptions**:
- Good: Guides acknowledge limited/no electricity, connectivity, infrastructure
- Good: Offline-first, low-bandwidth design

**Educational assumptions**:
- Current guides appropriately don't assume Western educational models
- Uses "technical knowledge" not "education level"

**Recommendation**: Maintain current approach. No changes needed.

---

### 7. Economic and Class Language

**Finding**: Respectful and appropriate.

**Good practices**:
- "Resource-constrained" not "poor" or "underdeveloped"
- "Low-resource settings" focuses on context, not people
- "Limited funding" states fact without judgment

**Avoid** (not found in current guides, but worth stating):
- ✗ "Third World," "developing world" → ✓ Specific region or "Global South" if appropriate
- ✗ "Poor countries," "backward" → ✓ "Countries experiencing [specific challenge]"
- ✗ "Primitive technology" → ✓ "Appropriate technology," "context-appropriate solutions"

---

### 8. Gender Language

**Finding**: Excellent throughout.

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Consistent use of "they/them" as singular
- ✅ "Staffers," "team members," "professionals" (gender-neutral job titles)
- ✅ Examples use diverse names when needed
- ✅ No assumptions about family structure or relationships
- ✅ "People," "individuals," "community members" rather than "men and women" (which excludes non-binary people)

**Example of good practice** (STYLE_Humanitarian_Executive.md:310):
> "Women and girls in displacement settings face heightened protection risks..."

This is appropriate because:
- Names specific populations when relevant to protection analysis
- Uses inclusive "women and girls" when discussing GBV (appropriate in humanitarian context)
- Doesn't use gendered language unnecessarily elsewhere

## Recommended Edits

### Priority 1: Required Changes

**1. Replace "elderly" with "older adults"** (1 occurrence)

File: `STYLE_Humanitarian_Executive.md`, line 330

Current:
> "digital exclusion of elderly and illiterate community members"

Recommended:
> "digital exclusion based on age or literacy background"

Or:
> "ensuring digital systems are accessible to older adults and people with diverse literacy backgrounds"

**2. Replace "illiterate" with inclusive alternative** (1 occurrence)

Same location as above.

Recommended approaches:
- Remove labels: "parallel paper-based systems for those using non-written formats"
- Neutral description: "people with diverse literacy backgrounds"
- Focus on solution: "systems accessible regardless of reading/writing abilities"

---

### Priority 2: Additions to Style Guides

Add an **Inclusive Language section** to each style guide with guidance on:

**Recommended section to add**:

```markdown
## Inclusive Language Principles

### Default to Universal Inclusion

Write from the perspective that everyone is included by default. Avoid language that sets groups apart or defines people by what they cannot do.

**Person-first vs. identity-first language**:
- Many communities have preferences (disability, cultural, etc.)
- When in doubt, use person-first: "person with [characteristic]" not "[characteristic] person"
- Or avoid labels entirely by focusing on needs/barriers

**Age**:
- ✓ "older adults," "older people" ✗ "elderly," "senior citizens"
- ✓ "younger people," "young adults" ✗ "kids," "youngsters" (in professional contexts)
- ✓ "people of all ages"

**Ability and access**:
- ✓ "people with disabilities" or "disabled people" (both acceptable)
- ✓ Focus on barriers: "inaccessible system" not "people who can't access"
- ✓ "wheelchair user" ✗ "wheelchair-bound," "confined to wheelchair"
- ✓ Universal design principles: "accessible to all" not "accessible to people with disabilities"

**Literacy and language**:
- ✓ "people who communicate in non-written formats," "oral communication users"
- ✓ "respecting diverse literacy backgrounds"
- ✗ "illiterate," "uneducated" (deficit-based)

**Economic situations**:
- ✓ "resource-constrained contexts," "limited funding"
- ✓ "low-resource settings" (describes context, not people)
- ✗ "poor people," "the poor" (labels people by economic status)

**Cultural and geographic**:
- ✓ Specific regions: "East Africa," "Sahel," "Caribbean"
- ✓ "Global South" (if appropriate and relevant)
- ✗ "Third World," "developing world," "backward," "primitive"

**In humanitarian contexts**:
- ✓ "Vulnerable" is acceptable when describing situational vulnerability (people in crisis)
- ✓ "Affected populations" (shared experience of event)
- ✓ "Communities we serve," "people we work with" (emphasizes partnership)
- Consider context: "participant" (active), "beneficiary" (standard but passive), "rights-holder" (rights-based)

### General Principles

1. **Agency and dignity**: Emphasize what people can do, their strengths, and their decision-making
2. **Barriers, not deficits**: Focus on systemic barriers, not individual limitations
3. **Temporary situations**: Most vulnerability is situational, not inherent
4. **Community expertise**: Local knowledge and community-identified solutions come first
5. **Universal inclusion**: Design and write for everyone from the start, not as accommodation

### Examples

**Deficit framing** ✗:
- "Poor people can't afford smartphones"
- "Illiterate users need simpler interfaces"
- "Vulnerable populations require special protection"

**Inclusive framing** ✓:
- "Cost barriers prevent some community members from accessing smartphones"
- "Interfaces should support multiple communication formats—written, oral, visual"
- "People in displacement settings face heightened protection risks due to [specific factors]"

**Before**: "The system accommodates disabled users"
**After**: "The system is designed to be accessible to everyone"

**Before**: "Training for low-skilled staff"
**After**: "Training builds on existing knowledge and develops new technical skills"

**Before**: "Beneficiaries receive assistance"
**After**: "Communities access services" or "People participate in programs"
```
