# Contributing to the Writing Style Guides

These guides document patterns for replicating a specific writing voice. Your contributions help make them more useful.

## What Makes Sense to Contribute

**Additions that improve the guides**:
- Examples from your own writing showing the style in action
- Patterns you've noticed that aren't captured yet
- Clarifications where something is unclear
- Corrections where something is wrong
- Additional audience contexts not currently covered

**Feedback that helps**:
- "This section doesn't work for [context]"
- "Here's what's missing from [guide]"
- "This contradicts [other section]"
- "I tried this approach and [result]"

## What Probably Doesn't Fit

**Things that change the fundamental voice**:
- Different stylistic preferences (this documents a specific voice, not general writing advice)
- Alternative approaches that conflict with core patterns
- Style changes that make it not sound like the source

**Generic writing advice**:
- This isn't a general writing guide
- It captures specific patterns from specific professional contexts
- If it applies to everyone's writing, it probably doesn't belong here

## How to Contribute

**Simple approach**:
1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request explaining what and why

**No bureaucracy**:
- No contributor license agreement
- No formal approval process beyond "does this improve the guides?"
- No style enforcement on your commit messages or PR descriptions

## Review Criteria

When reviewing contributions, we'll ask:

**Does this make the guides more useful?**
- Does it help someone replicate the voice more accurately?
- Does it clarify something that was confusing?
- Does it add value that wasn't there before?

**Is it consistent with the documented patterns?**
- Does it align with the voice captured in the guides?
- Does it fit the audience-specific adaptations?
- Is it grounded in actual examples?

**Is it maintainable?**
- Can someone else understand and update this in the future?
- Does it add complexity that isn't necessary?
- Does it create dependencies on external resources that might disappear?

## What You're Getting Into

**These guides are opinionated**:
- They capture a specific professional voice
- They reflect specific values (anti-oppressive language, cross-linguistic accessibility, open source advocacy)
- They assume certain professional contexts
- If you disagree with fundamental approaches, this might not be the right project to contribute to

**These guides evolve**:
- As the source writing evolves, guides should too
- Professional experience changes over time
- New contexts emerge
- Updates to reflect current practice are normal and expected

**These guides are incomplete**:
- No analysis captures everything
- Blind spots exist
- Your perspective fills gaps that can't be seen from a single viewpoint

## Areas Where Contributions Are Especially Welcome

**Audience-specific examples**:
- The Staff Development guide is brand new and light on examples
- Humanitarian contexts could use more field-specific scenarios
- Academic contexts could use more discipline-specific adaptations

**Cultural context**:
- These guides reflect primarily US professional contexts
- International perspectives on professional communication differ
- Adaptations for non-US contexts would be valuable

**Accessibility improvements**:
- Better examples of translation-friendly language
- Screen reader compatibility in the guides themselves
- Clearer language for non-native English speakers

**Technical improvements**:
- Better integration with AI platforms
- Improved routing logic in STYLE_INDEX.md
- Tools to validate writing against the guides

## What Happens After You Contribute

**Review process**:
- Someone with context will review your PR
- They might ask clarifying questions
- They might suggest modifications
- Timeline: when someone has time (this is not a commercial project)

**If your PR is merged**:
- Your contribution becomes part of the guides
- Attribution happens through git history
- The guides get better because of your input

**If your PR isn't merged**:
- You'll get an explanation of why
- Might be "this doesn't fit the project scope"
- Might be "this conflicts with documented patterns"
- Might be "timing isn't right but revisit later"

## Attribution

Contributors are credited through git commit history. No separate AUTHORS file, no elaborate attribution system. The git log shows who contributed what.

## License

This project doesn't currently have a formal license. That's intentional—these guides document a specific individual's writing patterns. Use them to understand the voice, but recognize they're contextual to specific professional experience and background.

If you're uncomfortable contributing without a clear license, open an issue to discuss it before submitting a PR.

## Questions?

Open an issue. Someone will respond when they have time.

This is a documentation project, not a software project. The bar for contribution is "does this make the guides more useful?" not "does this meet 47 code quality standards?"

Keep it simple. Keep it useful. Everyone is welcome.
