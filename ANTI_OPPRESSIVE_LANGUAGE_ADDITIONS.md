# Anti-Oppressive Language Framework
## For Tom Jordan's Style Guides

**Purpose**: Move beyond "inclusive language" to **actively anti-racist, anti-classist, anti-sexist, anti-ableist** writing that challenges systems of oppression.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Center Marginalized Voices and Knowledge

**Don't just include—actively center the expertise and leadership of people historically excluded from power.**

**In practice**:
- ✓ "Community-led solutions," "community-identified priorities"
- ✓ "National staff leadership" not "national staff support"
- ✓ "Local technical expertise" not "local capacity building" (implies they lack capacity)
- ✓ Name and credit Indigenous knowledge, traditional practices, community wisdom
- ✗ Positioning external "experts" as bringing knowledge to "teach" locals

**Example reframe**:
- **Before**: "We will build local capacity to manage systems"
- **After**: "Local teams will lead system management, with external support transitioning out as they determine"

**Before**: "Training local partners on best practices"
**After**: "Learning from local partners' expertise while sharing complementary technical approaches"

---

### 2. Actively Challenge White Supremacy and Colonialism

**Recognize that "neutral" often means "centering Whiteness and Western approaches."**

**Question these defaults**:
- Who is positioned as the expert?
- Whose knowledge counts as "best practice"?
- What cultural norms are assumed (e.g., direct communication, individualism, written documentation)?
- Are we imposing Western frameworks or learning from local ones?

**Language changes**:
- ✗ "Best practices from [Western country]" → ✓ "Approaches adapted from [specific context] and refined through [local] experience"
- ✗ "International standards" (whose standards?) → ✓ "Approaches aligned with [specific framework] and local practice"
- ✗ "Developed world" / "developing world" → ✓ Specific regions or "Global South/North" with awareness these terms also have problems
- ✓ Name colonialism when relevant: "Post-colonial contexts where infrastructure investment was deliberately withheld"

**Active anti-racism**:
- ✓ Name racism when discussing disparities: "Racism in emergency response systems leads to..."
- ✓ "Historically excluded from technology access due to racist policies"
- ✓ "Structural racism creates barriers to..." not just "barriers exist"

---

### 3. Actively Challenge Classism

**Recognize that economic oppression is systemic, not individual failure.**

**Language shifts**:
- ✗ "Poor planning" (implies failure) → ✓ "Under-resourced due to systemic disinvestment"
- ✗ "Limited capacity" (deficit) → ✓ "Operating under resource constraints imposed by [funding structures]"
- ✗ "They lack resources" (implies lack) → ✓ "Resources have been withheld/redistributed away from communities"
- ✓ Name economic exploitation: "Extractive economic policies," "wealth extraction"

**Anti-classist framing**:
- ✗ "Affordable solutions for resource-poor settings"
- ✓ "Cost-effective solutions that counter economic barriers created by unequal resource distribution"

**Challenge meritocracy myths**:
- ✗ "Highly skilled staff" (implies others are unskilled)
- ✓ "Staff with deep technical knowledge" and separately "Staff with deep community knowledge" (both are skills)
- ✓ Recognize all work has value: "Support staff" not "unskilled staff"

**Tom's lived experience with class**:
- Farm background: "We didn't have a lot growing up. If you wanted something, you bought it broken and fixed it."
- This shapes repair culture mindset, appropriate technology thinking, understanding of resource constraints
- Not romanticizing poverty—acknowledging how class background shapes technical approach
- Informs empathy for field contexts where newest/shiniest isn't available or appropriate

---

### 4. Actively Challenge Sexism and Patriarchy

**Goes beyond gender-neutral language to challenge power structures.**

**Active anti-sexism**:
- ✓ "Women and gender-diverse people leading..."
- ✓ Name patriarchy when relevant: "Patriarchal power structures limit women's access to..."
- ✓ "Gender-based violence" not "violence against women" (more inclusive, recognizes LGBTQ+ people)
- ✓ "All genders" not "both genders"

**Challenge gendered assumptions**:
- ✗ "Protecting women and children" (infantilizes women, positions them as vulnerable)
- ✓ "People of all genders experiencing heightened risks" or "Women and girls facing specific protection threats due to [systemic factors]"
- ✓ Name the perpetrators: "Men's violence against women" not "violence against women" (passive)

**Representation**:
- ✓ Use diverse names in examples (not all Western, not all male-coded)
- ✓ Show women in technical and leadership roles in examples
- ✓ Show men in care and support roles in examples

---

### 5. Actively Challenge Ableism

**Move from accommodation model to universal design and disability justice.**

**Language shifts**:
- ✗ "Special needs," "differently abled" → ✓ "Disabled people" or "people with disabilities" (disabled community preference varies)
- ✗ "Suffering from," "afflicted with" → ✓ "Person who experiences," "disabled person"
- ✗ "Overcome disability" → ✓ "Navigate ableist barriers"

**Active anti-ableism**:
- ✓ Name ableism: "Ableist infrastructure design excludes..." not "People with disabilities can't access"
- ✓ "Inaccessible systems create barriers" not "People are unable to access"
- ✓ Center disability justice: "Accessible by design" not "accommodations for special needs"

**Challenge productivity norms**:
- ✗ "High-performing teams" (implies ableist productivity standards)
- ✓ "Effective teams working within sustainable workloads"
- ✗ "Optimize productivity" → ✓ "Support sustainable, humane work practices"

---

### 6. Actively Challenge Other Systems of Oppression

**Age oppression (ageism)**:
- ✗ "Digital natives" vs "digital immigrants" (age hierarchy)
- ✓ "People with different technology experiences"
- ✓ Name ageism: "Age discrimination in hiring," "Ageist assumptions about technology"

**LGBTQ+ inclusion and anti-heteronormativity**:
- ✗ "Husbands and wives," "families with children"
- ✓ "Partners," "spouses," "family members," "families of all configurations"
- ✓ "People of all genders and sexual orientations"
- ✓ "LGBTQ+ people facing heightened discrimination..."

**Anti-nationalism and border justice**:
- ✗ "Illegal immigrant" → ✓ "Undocumented person" or "person without legal status"
- ✗ "Foreign workers" (othering) → ✓ "International staff" or specific nationality if relevant
- ✓ Question borders: "People whose movement is restricted by border policies"

## Structural Analysis: Who Has Power in Our Writing?

### Examine Your Style Guides for These Patterns:

**1. Who is positioned as having expertise/authority?**
- Do examples show diverse people as technical experts?
- Are "international experts" always positioned above "local staff"?
- Is community knowledge valued as much as technical/academic knowledge?

**2. Who is the default "professional" or "executive"?**
- Are examples/language assuming Whiteness, maleness, able-bodiedness?
- Do examples challenge these assumptions?

**3. Whose experiences are centered?**
- Are humanitarian guides centering Western aid workers or affected communities?
- Are IT guides centering executives or all workers?

**4. What is assumed as "normal"?**
- Is full-time salaried employment assumed?
- Is nuclear family assumed?
- Is English fluency assumed?
- Is higher education assumed?

## Specific Anti-Oppressive Additions for Each Guide

### For IT Executive Guide:

**Add section on equity in technology investment**:

```markdown
## Equity and Justice in Technology Decisions

Technology investments can reinforce or challenge existing inequities.

**Questions to ask**:
- Who benefits from this technology decision?
- Who is excluded or harmed?
- Does this reinforce existing power structures or redistribute resources?
- Are we automating discrimination? (AI, algorithms, automated decision-making)
- Does this create barriers for already-marginalized staff or students?

**Example**:
- ✗ "Biometric authentication improves security" → May exclude people with disabilities, create surveillance risks for immigrants/undocumented people
- ✓ "Authentication systems that work for all staff while respecting privacy and avoiding exclusion"

**Explicitly address**:
- Digital equity and access gaps
- Surveillance capitalism and privacy justice
- Algorithmic bias and discrimination
- Environmental justice (e-waste, climate impact of technology)
```

### For Academic Guide:

**Add section on epistemic justice**:

```markdown
## Epistemic Justice and Knowledge Systems

Universities have historically excluded and devalued knowledge from marginalized communities.

**Active anti-oppression in academic technology**:
- ✓ Support Indigenous knowledge systems, not just Western academic frameworks
- ✓ Multilingual systems (not English-default)
- ✓ Multiple ways of knowing (oral, visual, experiential, not just written/text)
- ✓ Question whose research is funded, published, valued

**Technology decisions should ask**:
- Does this reinforce Western academic hierarchies?
- Does this support diverse ways of teaching and learning?
- Are we consulting with diverse faculty, students, staff—especially those historically excluded?
```

### For Humanitarian Guides:

**Add section on power and positionality**:

```markdown
## Power, Positionality, and Anti-Colonialism

Humanitarian aid has colonial roots and can reinforce or challenge power imbalances.

**Active anti-oppression**:
- ✓ "Community-led response with external support" not "we are helping them"
- ✓ Name power: "As external actors with disproportionate funding and decision-making power..."
- ✓ "Accountable to communities" not "serving beneficiaries" (power relationship is reversed)
- ✓ Question: Are we reinforcing dependency or supporting self-determination?

**Language shifts**:
- ✗ "Capacity building" (implies they lack capacity)
- ✓ "Solidarity and mutual learning"
- ✗ "Vulnerable populations" (can imply inherent weakness)
- ✓ "People made vulnerable by [specific systems of oppression]"
- ✗ "Humanitarian intervention"
- ✓ "Humanitarian response in support of community-led efforts"

**Name colonialism and imperialism**:
- ✓ "Post-colonial contexts where infrastructure was deliberately underdeveloped"
- ✓ "Colonial resource extraction continues to impact..."
- ✓ "Western governments whose foreign policies created displacement"
```

### For Technical Guides (All):

**Add section on technology and liberation**:

```markdown
## Technology as Tool for Liberation or Oppression

Technology is never neutral—it reinforces or challenges existing power structures.

**Questions for every technical decision**:
- Does this put power in community hands or concentrate it externally?
- Does this create dependency or build autonomy?
- Who controls the data? Who benefits from its collection?
- Does this enable surveillance or privacy?
- Is this extractive (taking data/knowledge out) or generative (building local capacity)?

**Active anti-oppression in technical work**:
- ✓ Open source over proprietary (reduces dependency, enables local modification)
- ✓ Local data sovereignty (data stays with communities)
- ✓ Technology transfer, not just deployment (teach and leave skills)
- ✓ Offline-first, low-resource design (challenges class barriers)
- ✓ Privacy-by-design (resists surveillance)
```

---

## Intersectionality

**Remember: Oppressions intersect and compound.**

A Black woman faces both racism and sexism—not separately but as compounded experience.
A disabled refugee faces ableism, xenophobia, and often racism/classism simultaneously.

**In writing**:
- ✓ "Women, especially women of color and disabled women, face..."
- ✓ "Communities experiencing multiple forms of marginalization"
- ✓ Don't treat oppressions as separate checklists

---

## Self-Reflection Questions for Writers

Before publishing any content using these guides, ask:

1. **Who is centered in this piece?** Whose expertise and leadership is highlighted?

2. **What power dynamics are present?** Am I reinforcing or challenging them?

3. **What am I assuming as "normal"?** Who does that exclude?

4. **Have I named systems of oppression** when discussing barriers/disparities? Or am I obscuring root causes?

5. **Does this challenge or reinforce** existing hierarchies (racial, class, gender, ability, age, geographic, linguistic)?

6. **Would this piece be meaningful to people most impacted** by the issue? Or only to people with power?

7. **Am I speaking FOR marginalized communities** or amplifying their voices?

8. **Does my language assume Whiteness, maleness, able-bodiedness, wealth, Western culture** as default?

9. **Have I acknowledged my own positionality and power?** (For Tom: White, male, US citizen, technology access, institutional position, etc.)

10. **Does this move toward justice** or maintain status quo?

---

## Practical Implementation

### For Each Style Guide, Add:

**Required Section**: "Anti-Oppressive Language and Justice Framework"

Include:
- Core principles (center marginalized voices, challenge systems)
- Specific oppressions to actively work against (racism, classism, sexism, ableism, etc.)
- Self-reflection questions
- Examples of language shifts
- Intersectionality considerations

### In Example Transformations:

Show how anti-oppressive framing changes the examples:

**Before (neutral/inclusive)**:
> "Technology solutions must be adapted to local context and respect community practices."

**After (actively anti-oppressive)**:
> "Community-identified technology approaches, grounded in local knowledge systems, must lead implementation. External technical support serves community priorities, not external agendas. We acknowledge our role as guests in communities who have solutions we can learn from."

## Conclusion

Anti-oppressive writing requires:
1. **Centering marginalized voices** and leadership
2. **Naming systems of oppression** explicitly (racism, classism, ableism, etc.)
3. **Challenging power structures** in our language
4. **Questioning all assumptions** about who is "normal" or "default"
5. **Accountability to communities** most impacted
6. **Intersectional analysis** recognizing compounded oppressions
7. **Continuous learning** and willingness to be corrected

This is not a checklist—it's an ongoing practice of **actively working against injustice through how we write, who we center, and what we challenge.**
