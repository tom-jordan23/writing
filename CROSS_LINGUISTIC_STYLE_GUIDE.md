# Cross-Linguistic Writing Guide
## Translation-Friendly Communication Across Languages

**Purpose**: Ensure all writing translates clearly through automated and human translation, respects linguistic diversity, and avoids English-centric cultural references.

**Principle**: Write for a global, multilingual audience where English may not be the first language and cultural contexts vary widely.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Straightforward Language for Machine Translation

**Why this matters**:
- Your humanitarian work spans multiple languages (French, Spanish, Arabic, others)
- Field staff may be using Google Translate, DeepL, or other tools
- Idioms and metaphors break machine translation
- Clear, direct language translates more accurately

**Write for translation**:
- ✓ Simple, clear sentence structure
- ✓ Active voice (translates more reliably than passive)
- ✓ Literal meanings, not figurative
- ✓ Standard vocabulary, not colloquialisms

---

## 2. Avoid English-Centric Idioms and Expressions

**Idioms do not translate** - They become nonsensical or change meaning entirely.

### Common Idioms to AVOID:

**Business/Tech idioms**:
- ✗ "Low-hanging fruit" → ✓ "Easy initial improvements" or "Quick wins"
- ✗ "Move the needle" → ✓ "Create measurable impact" or "Improve outcomes"
- ✗ "Game-changer" → ✓ "Significant improvement" or "Fundamental shift"
- ✗ "Take it to the next level" → ✓ "Improve significantly" or "Advance further"
- ✗ "Think outside the box" → ✓ "Consider non-traditional approaches" or "Innovate"
- ✗ "Silver bullet" → ✓ "Single solution" or "Complete solution"
- ✗ "Ballpark figure" → ✓ "Rough estimate" or "Approximate cost"
- ✗ "Touch base" → ✓ "Connect" or "Follow up"
- ✗ "Circle back" → ✓ "Return to this topic" or "Revisit"
- ✗ "Deep dive" → ✓ "Detailed analysis" or "Thorough examination"
- ✗ "Drill down" → ✓ "Examine in detail" or "Look more closely"
- ✗ "Ramp up" → ✓ "Increase" or "Expand"
- ✗ "Spin up" → ✓ "Create" or "Deploy"

**Action/Sports idioms**:
- ✗ "Tackle the problem" → ✓ "Address the problem" or "Solve the problem"
- ✗ "Hit the ground running" → ✓ "Start immediately with full productivity"
- ✗ "Slam dunk" → ✓ "Certain success" or "Clear choice"
- ✗ "Level playing field" → ✓ "Equal opportunity" or "Fair conditions"
- ✗ "Home run" → ✓ "Major success"
- ✗ "Drop the ball" → ✓ "Make a mistake" or "Fail to complete"

**Common expressions**:
- ✗ "At the end of the day" → ✓ "Ultimately" or "In conclusion"
- ✗ "Apples to apples" → ✓ "Direct comparison" or "Equivalent comparison"
- ✗ "Boil the ocean" → ✓ "Attempt something impossible" or "Too large in scope"
- ✗ "Elephant in the room" → ✓ "Obvious issue being avoided"
- ✗ "Cutting edge" → ✓ "Latest technology" or "Most advanced"
- ✗ "Bleeding edge" → ✓ "Very newest, unproven technology"

### Idioms Found in Current Style Guides - TO REMOVE:

**STYLE.md**:
- ✗ "jump ship" → ✓ "leave for other opportunities" or "resign"
- ✗ "through its paces" → ✓ "test thoroughly" or "test comprehensively"
- ✗ "put the same rigor" → ✓ "apply the same thoroughness" or "maintain the same standards"

---

## 3. Avoid Culturally-Specific Contexts and References

**Not everyone shares Western/American cultural knowledge.**

### Avoid These Cultural References:

**Sports analogies** (American football, baseball, cricket vary by region):
- ✗ "Monday morning quarterback" → ✓ "Retroactive criticism"
- ✗ "Throw a Hail Mary" → ✓ "Attempt a risky last effort"
- ✗ "Three strikes" → ✓ "Three attempts" or "Three failures"

**Historical/Cultural events** (unless globally known):
- ✗ References to US-specific holidays, events, or history
- ✓ If needed, explain: "In the United States, [event] refers to..."

**Pop culture**:
- ✗ References to TV shows, movies, songs (even if popular in US/UK)
- ✗ Brand names used as verbs: "Google it," "Xerox this"
- ✓ Generic terms: "Search online," "Make a copy"

**Food/Cooking metaphors** (vary greatly by culture):
- ✗ "Too many cooks in the kitchen" → ✓ "Too many people making decisions"
- ✗ "Low simmer" → ✓ "Manage at low intensity"
- ✗ "Half-baked idea" → ✓ "Incomplete idea" or "Poorly thought out"

**Weather/Nature** (may not translate to all climates):
- ✗ "Snowball effect" → ✓ "Compounding effect" or "Accelerating growth"
- ✗ "Perfect storm" → ✓ "Convergence of problems"

**Religious references** (even secularized):
- ✗ "Preaching to the choir" → ✓ "Telling people what they already believe"
- ✗ "Devil's advocate" → ✓ "Arguing the opposing view"
- ✗ "Leap of faith" → ✓ "Decision with uncertain outcome"

---

## 4. Avoid Analogies and Metaphors That Don't Translate

**Use literal language instead.**

### Problematic Analogies:

**Technology analogies**:
- ✗ "Like building a plane while flying it" → ✓ "Implementing while still designing"
- ✗ "Putting out fires" → ✓ "Responding to urgent issues"

**Military analogies** (can be offensive in conflict zones):
- ✗ "In the trenches" → ✓ "Doing the detailed work"
- ✗ "Battle-tested" → ✓ "Proven in difficult conditions"
- ✗ "War room" → ✓ "Operations center" or "Command center"

**Construction/Building analogies** (overused, don't always translate):
- ✗ "Build from the ground up" → ✓ "Create from the beginning"
- ✗ "Lay the foundation" → ✓ "Establish the basis"
- ⚠️ Can use if explained: "Foundation (the base on which everything else is built)"

---

## 5. Sentence Structure for Translation

### Keep Sentences Simple and Clear

**Good for translation**:
- One main idea per sentence
- Subject-verb-object order
- Active voice
- Short to medium length (15-25 words ideal)
- Parallel structure in lists

**Example - Poor for translation**:
> "Having been widely reported as one of the most significant vulnerabilities, the issue, which affected thousands of systems, remained unpatched, illustrating challenges organizations face."

**Example - Good for translation**:
> "This vulnerability affected thousands of systems. Despite widespread reports of its significance, many systems remained unpatched. This illustrates the challenges organizations face."

**Why it's better**:
- Three simple sentences, not one complex sentence
- Clear subject-verb-object in each
- Active voice
- One idea per sentence

---

### Use Standard Punctuation

**For machine translation**:
- ✓ Periods, commas, colons - translate well
- ⚠️ Em-dashes, semicolons - can confuse some MT systems
- ✗ Excessive punctuation marks (!!!, ???) - problematic

**Your base style uses em-dashes frequently** - This is fine for English readers, but consider:
- For multilingual documents: Use parentheses or split into two sentences
- For English-only: Em-dashes are fine

---

## 6. Vocabulary Choices

### Use International English, Not Regional Dialects

**Avoid American English colloquialisms**:
- ✗ "Gotten" → ✓ "Received" or "Obtained"
- ✗ "Real" (as intensifier) → ✓ "Very" or "Extremely"
- ✗ "Kinda," "Sorta" → ✓ "Somewhat," "Rather"

**Avoid British English slang**:
- ✗ "Brilliant" (as praise) → ✓ "Excellent"
- ✗ "Quite" (means "very" in UK, "somewhat" in US) → ✓ Be specific

**Use internationally recognized technical terms**:
- ✓ Standard industry terminology (NIST, ISO, IFRC frameworks)
- ✓ English technical terms widely understood globally
- ✓ Spell out acronyms on first use

---

### Avoid Phrasal Verbs When Possible

**Phrasal verbs** (verb + preposition) are uniquely difficult to translate.

**Replace with single-word verbs**:
- ✗ "Set up" → ✓ "Configure" or "Establish"
- ✗ "Take on" → ✓ "Accept" or "Undertake"
- ✗ "Come up with" → ✓ "Develop" or "Create"
- ✗ "Figure out" → ✓ "Determine" or "Solve"
- ✗ "Point out" → ✓ "Identify" or "Indicate"
- ✗ "Carry out" → ✓ "Conduct" or "Execute"
- ✗ "Look into" → ✓ "Investigate" or "Examine"
- ✗ "Put together" → ✓ "Assemble" or "Create"

**Exception**: Some phrasal verbs are very common and translate well:
- ✓ "Log in" (widely understood)
- ✓ "Back up" (data backup - standard term)
- ✓ "Shut down" (system shutdown - standard term)

---

## 7. Numbers, Dates, and Measurements

### Use International Formats

**Dates**:
- ✓ **ISO 8601**: 2025-11-24 or "24 November 2025"
- ✗ US format: 11/24/2025 (ambiguous internationally)
- ✗ UK format: 24/11/2025 (ambiguous to Americans)

**Numbers**:
- ✓ Use spaces or commas clearly: 1,000 or 1 000
- ⚠️ Decimal separators vary (US: 1.5; Europe: 1,5) - be aware in multicultural contexts
- ✓ Spell out very large numbers: "5 million" not "5,000,000"

**Currency**:
- ✓ Always specify: USD, EUR, GBP, etc.
- ✓ "US$1,000" or "$1,000 USD"
- ✗ Just "$1,000" (which dollar?)

**Measurements**:
- ✓ Use metric primarily (international standard)
- ✓ If using imperial, provide metric: "5 feet (1.5 meters)"
- ✓ Temperature: Celsius (international) with Fahrenheit if needed

**Time**:
- ✓ 24-hour format or specify AM/PM clearly
- ✓ Include time zone: "14:00 UTC" or "2:00 PM EST"

---

## 8. Technical Terminology

### When Technical Terms Are Needed

**Use them clearly and consistently**:
- ✓ Spell out acronyms on first use
- ✓ Use standard industry terms (they're often borrowed internationally)
- ✓ Define technical terms when introducing them
- ✓ Use the same term consistently (don't vary for style)

**Example**:
> "The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) provides a structured approach. The RMF includes seven steps..." [not "the framework," "this approach," "the method" - use RMF consistently]

---

## 9. Contractions and Informal Language

### Avoid Contractions in Formal/Technical Writing

**For translation clarity**:
- ✗ "It's" → ✓ "It is"
- ✗ "Don't" → ✓ "Do not"
- ✗ "Can't" → ✓ "Cannot"
- ✗ "Won't" → ✓ "Will not"

**Your base style uses rare contractions** - Good! Maintain this in multilingual contexts.

**Exception**: Humanitarian field communications may use contractions for informality/relationship-building, but formal reports should avoid them.

---

## 10. Cultural Sensitivity in Examples

### Use Diverse, Neutral Examples

**Names in examples**:
- ✓ Use internationally diverse names
- ✓ Include names from multiple regions: Ahmed, Li, Maria, Kwame, etc.
- ✗ Only use Western names (John, Sarah)

**Locations in examples**:
- ✓ Use diverse geographic examples
- ✓ Be specific: "In Nairobi, Kenya" not "In Africa"
- ✗ Always use US/European examples

**Scenarios**:
- ✓ Reflect diverse contexts (urban/rural, high/low resource)
- ✓ Don't assume Western business practices (9-5 work, email culture, etc.)

---

## 11. Avoid Humor and Sarcasm

**Humor rarely translates**:
- Different cultures find different things funny
- Sarcasm is easily misunderstood
- Irony doesn't translate through MT
- Self-deprecating humor varies culturally

**In professional technical writing**:
- ✓ Clear, direct communication
- ✗ Jokes, puns, wordplay
- ✗ Sarcasm or irony
- ✗ Cultural references for humor

**Exception**: Light, universal humor in long-form content can build rapport, but test with multilingual readers first.

---

## 12. Visual Communication

**When language fails, use visuals** (but make them accessible):

- ✓ Diagrams and flowcharts (universal)
- ✓ Icons with text labels
- ✓ Screenshots with annotations
- ✓ Tables and structured data

**Make visuals translation-friendly**:
- ✓ Separate text from images (so text can be translated)
- ✓ Use alt-text for accessibility and translation
- ✗ Text embedded in images (cannot be translated)

---

## Examples: Before and After

### Example 1: IT Executive Communication

**Before (English-centric, idioms)**:
> "We need to get ahead of this issue before it snowballs. Let's circle back after we've had a chance to drill down into the data and move the needle on our security posture. At the end of the day, we can't afford to drop the ball on this."

**After (Translation-friendly)**:
> "We must address this issue before it grows larger. We will reconvene after analyzing the data thoroughly and improving our security position significantly. This is critical and we cannot fail to complete it."

**Why it's better**:
- No idioms (snowballs, circle back, drill down, move the needle, drop the ball)
- Clear, direct statements
- Active voice
- Simple sentence structure

---

### Example 2: Humanitarian Field Communication

**Before (Cultural references, colloquial)**:
> "The field team is in the trenches dealing with this crisis. We need all hands on deck—this is a perfect storm of challenges. Let's touch base tomorrow and see if we can tackle the low-hanging fruit first."

**After (Translation-friendly)**:
> "The field team is managing this crisis in difficult conditions. We need everyone's support—multiple challenges are occurring simultaneously. We will meet tomorrow to address the most urgent issues first."

**Why it's better**:
- No military analogy ("in the trenches")
- No nautical reference ("all hands on deck")
- No weather metaphor ("perfect storm")
- No sports idiom ("tackle")
- No food metaphor ("low-hanging fruit")
- Literal, clear meaning

---

### Example 3: Technical Documentation

**Before (Phrasal verbs, casual)**:
> "To set up the system, first figure out your network config and then set that up. If issues come up, look into the logs to see what's going on. You might need to come up with a workaround if things don't pan out."

**After (Translation-friendly)**:
> "To configure the system, first determine your network configuration and then implement those settings. If problems occur, examine the logs to identify the issue. You may need to develop an alternative solution if the standard process fails."

**Why it's better**:
- Single-word verbs instead of phrasal verbs
- Precise technical terms
- Clear process flow
- Formal register

## Implementation Checklist

### For Each Document You Write:

**Pre-writing**:
- [ ] Consider: Will this be translated (machine or human)?
- [ ] Consider: What languages will readers speak?
- [ ] Consider: What cultural contexts will readers have?

**During writing**:
- [ ] Use simple sentence structure
- [ ] Choose literal words over figurative language
- [ ] Avoid idioms, slang, colloquialisms
- [ ] Use active voice
- [ ] Avoid phrasal verbs when possible
- [ ] Use standard vocabulary, not regional dialects
- [ ] Spell out acronyms on first use
- [ ] Use internationally recognized date/number formats

**After writing (editing pass)**:
- [ ] Remove any idioms or metaphors
- [ ] Replace culturally-specific references
- [ ] Simplify complex sentences
- [ ] Check that every sentence has one clear main idea
- [ ] Verify technical terms are defined
- [ ] Test with machine translation tool (Google Translate, DeepL)
- [ ] If possible, have a non-native English speaker review

---

## Testing Your Writing for Translation

### Use Machine Translation as a Test

**Process**:
1. Write your content
2. Run it through Google Translate or DeepL to Spanish/French/Arabic
3. Translate back to English
4. Compare - does meaning preserve?

**If meaning changes significantly**:
- Identify the problematic sentences
- Likely causes: idioms, complex structure, ambiguous pronouns
- Revise and test again

**Example test**:
- Original: "We need to tackle this before it snowballs"
- Spanish→English: "We need to face this before it becomes a snowball" (literal snow)
- **Problem identified**: Idioms don't translate

---

## Language Justice and Anti-Oppression

**Cross-linguistic writing is anti-oppressive practice**:
- Challenges English dominance
- Centers comprehension for non-native speakers
- Respects linguistic diversity
- Increases accessibility globally

**Recognize**:
- English as lingua franca doesn't mean English as default
- Requiring fluent English excludes many brilliant people
- Translation costs shouldn't be barrier to participation
- Local languages should be primary in local contexts

**Best practices**:
- Write in English for translation, not English for English-speakers only
- Support professional translation for critical documents
- Provide materials in multiple languages when possible
- Respect that concepts may not translate 1:1; work with translators on culturally appropriate framing

---

## Audience-Specific Guidance

### IT Executives
- International operations are common - write for global CIOs
- Avoid US business idioms ("leverage," "synergy," "bandwidth" as metaphor)
- Use international standards (ISO, not just US frameworks)

### Technical Practitioners
- Technical English is somewhat universal, but still avoid idioms
- Code comments should be clear (many developers aren't native English speakers)
- Documentation will be translated - keep it literal

### Academic/University
- International students, faculty, visiting scholars
- Academic English spans cultures - maintain formality
- Research collaborations are international - write for global peers

### Humanitarian Contexts
- **Critical**: Field staff often working in non-English languages
- Will be using translation tools in real-time
- Clear instructions can be life-saving
- Respect local languages as primary, English as working language
